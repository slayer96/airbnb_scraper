Recommended \n\nThe host canceled this reservation 71 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n\nOur trip to Budapest was work connected with tight schedule and tricky transportation (very early arrival / very late departure) but Borbala was an amazing host who made everything to help us. She's an amazing person so there's no surprise that her place must have been the same. The location, lot's of sunlight inside and that panorama from the balcony... Just to name a few. If you happen to find her apartment not booked, seek no more! You will remember it forever. Hope to have a chance to meet her again. Wouldn't change that Airbnb to any 5 stars hotel!\n\nReally nice and clean apartment, great view from the balcony. Bori is a really nice person, I can only recommend the place. The location is also great, you can get to all the important parts of the city in minutes. great bars around the block. Nice!\n\nbarbara was very, very friendly and greeted us warmly. She is an active and fast replied to all the questions. The house is comfortable and equipped with everything you need really. In particular landscape seen from the terrace is amazing!

City center is 10mins. Apartment is fully equiped, it gives complete comfort. A home away from home.\n\nThis sweet home lies at Naphegy (Sunhill) and as it says the name, it is a very bright place. So is it the apartment, being on the top (3rd) floor . In the house there are only 6 apartments, so it is mainly quiet. \nWhen you enter the apartment, you turn right and you find the small bathroom and kitchen. From the kitchen window you get a nice view on the houses at the other side of the street. \nBy turning left when you enter, you find a big space with the dining room and a huge living space. At the corner of the living room there is the couch with a double bed that accomodates a couple with nice sleeping, if guests would like to have their own space for sleeping, there is a double air mattress that can be used as well. \nFrom the living room you can go out to the balcony and enjoy the wonderful view on the Buda Castle and the West Walls of the Castle. \nI am sure that you will have an unforgetable time in Budapest when chosing to be my guest :)\n\nNext to the kitchen there is my bedroom, which the guests cannot use by now. It will be closed down. \nTo all other places guests have access to, and as the bedroom is only 4 squaremeter, and the whole apartment is 51, guest can enjoy a whole lot of space :)\nI will not be there at home, so the apartment will be yours for the time of your visit :)\n\nI will be mostly in Budapest. You can contact me anytime and I try my best to help you out with anything asap.\n\nThe neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful. Though it lies really close to the Buda Castle and the V\u00e1rkert Baz\u00e1r, it is not a touristic place anymore, there are mostly locals living on lovely Sunhill :)\n2 minutes walking there is the Tab\u00e1n park, which is really nice place, too. \nA lot of locals go there with their dogs or running, playing tennis and football, or just sitting on the bench and sunbath :)\n\nExcellent public transport.

Lovely stay. \n\nBorci maji radi cesky pivo ^^\n\nDario is a very cool guy. His apartment is very well placed in the city i.e very near to the metro station, making it quite accessible. Basic amenities were quite good, wifi was also provided. Since the checkout time was flexible we were able to enjoy the city very much and then later on collect our bags from his apartment. My group has enjoyed the stay and we would recommend others to stay at this place.\n\nI had a great stay at Dario's. He and his friends were very helpful and fun to hang out with. The flat is very central and easily to reach. The next time I'm in town I'd be happy to stay with them again.\n\nDario and his roommate was very nice and helpful. Apartment is located close to city center and the blue metro is just downstairs. Had a very nice stay.\n\nWhat an Airbnb experience at Dario's place. Dario tries to make everything possible happen. He first told me the only rule is that there was no rule. The appartment is a bit old but well located and for the price and Dario's kindness you couldn't be unhappy!Thanks Dario for accepting me at the last minute and contributing to my amazing stay in Budapest !\n\nGreat location- close to the major attractions of Budapest and easy access to the public transport. The room is basic as mentioned in the offer, but all I needed was a bed and shower so didn't expect much. Dario is a very nice and helpful guy, he makes me feel welcome from the moment I arrived. Cool atmosphere, friendly people. I'm really glad I booked it!\n\nI must say that Dario is a friendly and kind person... He even took time off to hang with me and showed some few places.\nThe room, I must say, was within my expectation; I was tight on budget and wanted something \"as cheap and simple\" as possible and I got it.\n\nIt a simple, cozy place; my advice is don't expect a \"5*\".\n\n\nI have to say that this Airbnb experience has been one of my best one! I have been doing a lot of times Airbnb before but this time I really felt like I was one of their (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)! Dario and his flatmate Giovani offered me coffee; showed me around and even cooked for me ! What else could you ask from a host ?\r\nThe room was really big and the location of the apartment was perfect, very central; close to supermarkets, bars and everything you would wish!

We purchased a two day ticket for the hop on bus from Balasz, which could be caught at a bus stop 2 minutes away. The metro train line is also only 2 minutes walk, so it was very convenient.\n\nWe stayed in winter which was lovely! The apartment is really well heated, and it took around 10-15 minutes to walk to the Christmas markets which were an absolute highlight.\n\nThe area is full of great cafe's and restaurants. We particularly enjoyed Menza up the street and recommend it to any guests (best coffee and breakfast we tried while staying)\n\nAnd of course the bath was fantastic to have after a long day walking out in the cold. \n\nA very well located and nice apartment in Budapest.\n\nThe apartment is very nice, stylish and cosy. The kitchen has everything that a tourist can need. The bathroom is spacious and clean. Overall staying in this apartment was a great part of our trip to Budapest!\n\nCouldn't recommend balazs apartment enough! It's clean, warm, a value for money and right in the centre! We couldn't have asked for more!\nEven though our plane from the uk ran 45 mins late, the transfer to the apartment was still smooth and on time and Emilia was there to meet us and recommend places to go and even provided us with a map! \nIf you're coming to Budapest this is the place to stay!\nThanks so much for having us!x\n\nEverything was perfect. The flat was exactly as described, well supplied, very comfortable and the location couldn't be better!\r\nBal\u00e1zs was very kind and accommodating, just like his friend Klara who welcomed us at the apartment. We had a very great time here at the flat and we really recommended it!\r\nMany thanks Klara and Balazs! :)\n\nBal\u00e1sz was very accommodating. He organised transportation to and from the airport which made for a smooth arrival and departure. The apartment is beautiful, very tastefully decorated and in a perfect, central location for exploring Budapest on foot, we didn't use public transportation at all as a result! I would highly recommend a stay here. \n\nMy friend and I had a very nice stay at Bal\u00e1sz's apartment. It was well furnished, tidy and very comfortable - also in a very good spot in Budapest, close to almost all the points of interest in town. Even though Bal\u00e1sz didn't greet us, a friend of him kindly showed us the apt and provided us with all the information about the city. \nRecommended!\n\nAlthough we did not see Balazs, we were made welcome by Emelia. I itiallywe did not have the keys through. O fault of their own.\n\nBalazs friend, Emilia, welcomed me to the flat. She made a lot of recommendations and they were all excellent! The flat itself is so charming and I loved the bath. I also made the mistake of doing my reservation dates wrong, so when the time came to check out I was not ready. They handled it with such grace, thank you Balazs and Emilia!\n\nWe did not meet Balazs in person, but we were welcomed perfectly by his friend Elizabeth. Transport from and to the AirPort was arranged, questions we had were answered within the hour. \r\n\r\nThe appartment itself matches the pictures exactly so that was beautiful, spacious and wel equipped.

And from time to time I got the chance to try Niki's home-made Hungarian foods that tasted absolutely delicious (I still remember the recipe for the potato gratin and I will make it for my family - if I find sausages similar to the Hungarian ones).\nMy room was so cozy and homey, it made me feel welcome right from the start. And also it looked just like the pictures - so no bad surprises there! \nWhen there is  another guest staying in the second room on the top floor, you have to share a bathroom with her and in my three months with Niki and Vajk it was never a problem sharing that bathroom. Even though the bathroom itself is not huge, it has everything one could need in it and still enough space to place your own toiletries there.\nI also loved the fact that Manna, Niki and Vajk's cat,  greeted me whenever I came home. She's such a sweet and cuddly bundle of fur :)\nThe apartment is located on the Buda side of the city which means it is about 15 Minutes by bus into the heart of the Jewish Quarter where all the nightlife is at. But I still think its a great location because it is really quiet. The only thing you do hear are sounds from the train station that is about 5 minutes walk away from the house. Apart from that it is perfect to find some peace and quiet and still be able to reach the city center whenever you feel like going out.\nTo whoever thinks about staying with Niki and Vajk I'd say: don't hesitate, it's a great room to stay in!\n\nI throughly enjoyed my stay at Vajk's. He and niki are wonderful hosts very warm and welcoming. I had the opportunity to chat with Vajk and you can tell he tries to do what he can to make his guests feel welcomed. There was open communication before and during my stay which made checkin very easy. I felt comfortable and at home a perfect way to relax after a long day of walking and sightseeing. My room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was clean as well and should you need the bus it pass right in front of the apartment's main door. I also loved Monna ,their cat so cute and fluffy:)\n\nVajk is very friendly! The location is very convenient, with the bus stop just in front of the building. The apartment looks just like the photos. There's a poster of the Pixar movie 'Up' on the room door and the decoration within really did remind me of the adventurous life of Carl and Ellie. :)\n\nLovely stay!\n\nI always went out for my work , so I didn't really interact with owners. But, it was good to have privacy and to use kitchen to cook!\r\nThey were kind hosts when i come to them asking something!\r\n\r\nIf you are hesitating for the room reservation, you don't have to hesitate.\r\nI recommend you to stay.\n\nWe spent a good time at Vajk's. He is very uncomplicated, we changed our booking at late notice and he had no problem with it at all and we could find a solution that benefitted everyone. This was very nice of him!\r\nThe room is very nice, big and looks quite cute. The private bathroom is good too. Vajk was very helpful, he gave us a map and offered to help us find something if we need it.\r\nThe bus really stops right in front of his place which is really convenient. The buda castle is also easily reachable on foot.\r\nI can recommend you very much to stay at Vajks place!\u263a\r\n\n\nIt is ok\nTransport facilities\n\nvery nice people, they made me feel at home, always willing to help me. the house is beautiful, comfortable, harmony and respect.\r\ni want to go back for more time, because the experience was very  good. im very grateful.\n\nI was really happy and glad during two weeks when I stayed in Vajk's house. Vajk, Niki, and Ili are so kind, helpful and the best host whom I ever met. They welcome their guests with their hearts. The room is totally same with the picture, beautiful and comfortable :D If I could stay in Budapest once again, I definitely would like to stay in his house. I strongly recommend you guys to stay in his house. It will be an awesome experience for you :) Thank you Vajk!\n\nIt's a very cozy room with comfortable bed and lovely decoration. The bus stop is right outside the building and actually I did more enjoy walking in Budapest. Vajk is very nice and he provided everything needed. Additionally, the kitty is so cute!

We waited for 20 minutes outside on a blistering cold Hungarian winter evening, without an apology from the hostess.\n\nLocation was good, close to public transports. The bed was average and hard to get into for someone taller as a child. The shower was still wet when we arrived at 9pm, which was weird. \n\nWe stayed two nights in Budapest at another airbnb for a similar price and had a better experience.\n\nThanks for the flexibility considering check-in times, though. \n\nAlexandra's house was exactly as mentioned; it was clean, extremely convenient to get around the city and perfect for my friend and I. We would definitely come back to Alexandra's accommodation if returning to Budapest. \n\nAlexandra never responded to my initial message, communication was always slow which is fustrating when you are dependent on wifi zones. When she did not arrive in time for our meeting infront of the building and I called her, she told me she was already there (she was not). She brought us up to the apartment then had us wait 15 minutes outside the door to clean, although we had left another friend downstairs to wait for us to drop our bags. A filled garbage bag from the previous guests was left behind. However, location is incredible, especially for the price. Great value, bad host.\n\nAlexandra was very helpful.\r\nThe apartment is small, but we only stayed for one night, so it was okay. \r\nThe only problem is that the sleeping section is very low-ceilinged, so you can't stand upright.\r\nThe apartment is practical for sightseeing because a lot of Budapest sights are nearby. \r\nIt's also good for nightlife-experience.\r\n \n\nAlexandra was really and helpful. We arrived Late in the Night but this was no Problem. The Flat is in the best neighboorhood -> jewish district!! We totally can recommend this Appartement! \n\nThe host, Alexandra, greeted us at the building, showed us the apartment and gave us all the basic info. She was easy to reach and communicate with before and during our stay. We loved the apartment! It is very cozy and nice, it has all the amenities you could possibly need and we loved it there. We felt very safe in the building complex. The location (Pest) is amazing, very central and close to everything we needed during our stay. It is close to Vaci and Andrassy streets, the Jewish quarter (great bars and restaurants), a bridge and metro stops. I can't praise the location enough. I would not only recommend this apartment, I would rent it again myself. \n\nAlexandra was very accomdating as we arrived later then expected. The space is small but was perfect for myself and my partner. The apartment is in a FAB location and is easy to get to from the airport and to get around the city! \n\nPlace is central and about 400 metres to Astoria metro. Round the corner there is a supermarket and the main road also has 24 hour shop. The apartment was quiet and easily accessible. The only real issue we had is the smallness of the place and since the bed is located in a mezzanine the ceiling is very low so you can't stand up properly. While this might not be a problem for many, it's worth keeping in mind if you are old or have back problems. Alexandra was helpful and communication was good. She also  helped in booking us a taxi to airport.\n\nAlexandra was very helpful, answered my emails beforehand and was at the flat to meet me. The flat is small but quiet and good value.

Take 76 bus to lehr metro (2 stops) turn right out of apartment building \n\ni like the automatic checkin and checkout system:) Andras gave me the detailed instruction in advance:)\n\nthere is one window only in the bedroom so the air in the kitchen n the bathroom was not so good.\n\nCosy flat. Responsive and easy-going owner. Good price. \n\nAndr\u00e1s was very accurate and polite. The location is perfect - close to metro,shop and the central part of the city. The only thing that disappointed me is that it was not very clean and there was a lot of dust. However we clean it for a short period of time and we were extremely satisfied with the apartment. I definitely recommend it!\n\nThe good points are: The automated system - so easy to come to and leave; location (close to metro and pretty central); great TV; modern; and all needs met.  The things that stopped it being a 10 are: bed is a large and quite hard sofa (you can see this in advance and via others comments and so not a huge negative); its small (but big enough as a cook; shower and sleep place); the bedroom/main room is pretty narrow.  For short stays its perfect.  We were granted late checkout too - so helpful host...\n\nThe flat conforms to the description : clean, functional, well located (close to Andrassy ut and the metro station). Very good value for money.\r\nWe didn't see Andr\u00e0s but he answered very quickly to our questions by message. \n\nSmall but cosy studio apartment in a great location. Good value and a communicative host. \n\nThe apartment was perfect for two people. It had everything we needed and the location was also great.

Even Netflix!\r\nThe location is good. Quiet, but near to main streets and local transport. We walked everywhere around the city during our stay as there's so much to see and take in.\r\nWe are both Vegetarians and found some amazing local places to eat near the apartment -  We loved Slow Foodies Restaurant for breakfast and lunch on different days- its a great vegan and veggie place- Really decent healthy but tasty food. Also at the Indian restaurant round the corner called Indigo- great variety of big vegetarian dishes- ask for them hot as they come mild. This was actually one of the best Indian meals we've had. A little bit further was the restaurant Napf\u00e9nyes \u00c9tterem -great big portions and local style cuisine. \r\nAll in all, a great host with a great friend and a great apartment. \r\n\n\nFantastic stay at Vivien's place!\nPerfect location and lovely apartment.\nPerfect for a couple on a city break.\n\nWalking distance from everywhere.

Lots of bars, restaurants and interesting nightlife within a short walking distance. Communication was the best of all my stays with Airbnb. Vivien was not around but her friend was available.  She was there to welcome us and take the keys when we left. Will also add she was extremely nice and very helpful in pointing us in the right direction. This was needed with such a big city with so much to see and do.\n\nOur stay at Vivien's Bohemian Treasure Box was perfect! \r\n\r\nThe place is adorable and has a great location for some of the best sites, bars and restaurants in Budapest. Vivien did a great job decorating and organizing the place and it was absolutely spotless with everything we needed in it. \r\n\r\nVivein went above and beyond as a host to make our stay great! \r\n\r\nI would 100% reccomend anyone to stay here and enjoy one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been to.\n\nHad a very pleasant stay , One lovely flat , very very lovely , nice host. The flat to rent in Budapest ! \n\nCute place in a good location. Vivien and her parents were very nice, communicating with them was easy.\n\nMy stay was amazing!! Highly recommend this listing! Vivien was prompt with communication from the start and even though she wasn't able to give me the keys personally, her friends stayed in contact me with me and made me feel super welcomed. The flat is clean and perfect for one or two people. I felt the location and building were extremely safe. I walked home alone at 11pm-4am a few times and never felt threatened. It's close to the grocery store, pharmacy, public transport, bars, and restaurants. Vivien was kind enough to provide enough essentials and even messaged me halfway through my trip to check on me. This became home and I miss it already. Thanks for everything! You were most accommodating :) \n\nWe really enjoyed our stay at this great bohemian flat. The flat itself was lovely and well equipped, just as advertised in the pictures. It's really well located for many of the sights and some fun places to go out in the evenings. The communication with Vivien was really easy and suited out requirements perfectly.  Highly recommended :)\n\nFirst of all I want to say thank you Vivien.

Lots of others have commented on the wifi and indeed I can confirm that the apartment has a very reliable internet connection.  The apartment is very close to the Chain Bridge and therefore an easy walk to the Pest side.  If you are staying for a few days I would recommend getting a metro pass and VodaPhone/T-Mobile Sim card to make your stay that much easier.  All in all, a solid, clean, safe apartment in a great location.  Thanks again Peter.  \n\nWe had a fantastic time at Peter's place. It was very clean and well looked after. Very good standard accommodation and well situated. We especially loved the walk over the Chain Bridge in the evening where you could look across at the illuminated buildings, truly wonderful. I would defiantly recommend Peter's to anyone visiting Budapest you will not be disappointed.\n\nIt's the second time I stayed in this lovely apartment. I love the location and the size is just ideal for a short stay. It would have been nice to meet someone in person instead of the let in yourself approach. The heat only goes up to 23 degrees, which was just enough, but I prefer if I have the control especially when it is so cold outside.\n\nI am greatful they allowed me to enter before the official check in time.\n\nThe location is everything - close to metro, trams, shopping. The apartment was spotless, large, and very thankful it is one the first level. I will definitely return to Budapest and Peter's apartment. ***** (5-star)\n\nPeter's place is in a great location, from where you can really appreciate the grandeur of Budapest as to get to the town centre it's just a short walk across the Chain bridge. The apartment style is elegant and the high ceilings give it a spaciousness that makes it a comfortable for more than just a few nights. Peter's place is great value!  \n\nThis place was perfect- close to everything, modern, clean and strong WIFI. Thanks Peter!! \n\nVery comfortable loft which is great for 2 people. Great location which is in walking distance from most of the tourist attractions. \n\nGreat location. Clean apartment. Spacious and comfortable. \n\nWe had a wonderful stay at Peter's apartment. Very close to public transport and walking distance to most of the things you'll want to see and do in Budapest. The apartment is beautiful, huge and clean. Excellent communication and instructions from Peter, would love to stay here again. Thanks again Peter!!\n\nPerfect location. Less than 10 mins walking distance to Castle Hill, right next to one of the most beautiful bridges and awesome views right around the corner. Very clean, modern apartment with anything that one could need for a stay in Budapest. Peter was a great host and was super accommodating. Very responsive and great with communication! Will definitely love to stay here again next time I am in Budapest!

Close to the City centre! Just be aware the owners live there with a cat and dog. Also you need to be able to climb up and down stairs as it's a loft double bed! \n\nAnna's apartment is so cute and in a great location! We arrived to Budapest pretty late at night, but Anna was accommodating and gave us a great suggestion for a ride from the airport. Her apartment was a great place to stay to explore the city and return to a cozy room at the end of the day.\n\nGreat place!\n\nAnna's place was so cute and cozy, really clean as well. We were within a few minutes walk from the metro, so it was so easy to reach when we arrived on the train and so easy to get around the city for exploring. The street the flat is on is full of great restaurants and is super lively, though not noisey. Would totally recommend this to anyone and would love to visit again! Also, her kitty and dog are super cute and friendly :)\n\nWe loved our trip to Budapest! The apartment is so central and easy to find from the airport. We found it super easy to navigate ourselves by foot to all the major attractions both at night and in the day. Anna's apartment is so warm, clean and cosy - we felt totally at home the moment we arrived (made even better by the beautiful cat). To add to that Anna and her boyfriend provided some wonderful recommendations for food and drinks and were in general totally lovely and welcoming. A great place for a couple to stay for a true Hungarian city break. Thankyou Anna!! (P.s eat as Fecske it's round the corner, totally local food and drink and so cheap but totally amazing- we ate there twice!)\n\nAnna's place is wonderful - totally recommend it! Love the location, she's is a great communicator & her home is perfectly decorated. Felt like I was at adult sleep away camp when climbing the ladder for the bed. Never got to meet Anna but her cat did give me enough love and attention to feel just as welcomed! I would happily stay again.\n\nLoved Anna's place! We felt really at home in her lovely apartment. It was clean, comfortable and exactly what we were after. Great to have our own bathroom and living area too. Will definitely stay again when we return to Budapest!\n\nMe and my boyfriend really enjoyed staying at Annas Place! It was all nice and tidy, towels, hairdryer and shampoo were already in the bathroom and the bed is quite comfortable! Only the blankets were a bit too short for us germans \n\neverything was Great, the room was cosy and clean. The Communication easy and fast. Would Love to come again!! \n\nAnne was a very good host. She waited up for arrival when our plane was delayed two hours. The room was very clear and we had everything we needed.

The location is great, central but at the same time in a less busy road which made finding parking easy. Everything is walking distance.\n\nWe have not met Marcell but he sent a clear instraction how to get inside the appartments. It is located very close to the historical part of the city, just 10 mins walk to the parlament and 1 min to a metro station.  I would recommend Marcell's appartment but not with a car as free parking is most time occupated and there is possibility to leave a car only after 10 pm. However there are lots of chargeable parking spaces at the streets and some garage with daily rates.\n\nThis a lovely and cute flat which was perfect for 4 girls wanting a city break. Right in the centre of Budapest, the location is spot on- close to restaurants, bars and general tourist destinations all within walking distance. Highly recommend.\n\nEverything was great, apt in the city centre, host is very welcoming person, and communication was very smooth and easy. \n\n VERY NICE FLAT ... NEW .. CLEAN AND NEAR EVERYTHING ....MARCELL IS VERY KIND ... FREE PARKING IS DIFFICULT TO FIND ....\n\nEverything was great! Marcell was a great host in the way that he was very easy to contact and was always responsive straight away. instructions on how to enter the building and how to acces the apartment were very clear.  Apartment was only a couple of blocks away from public transport and their's also an amazing all you can eat running sushi train around the corner!\n\nShopping centre and supermarkets near by. Tight squize for 3 people but it did the job. Wifi is excellent and the washing machine also works well. Located near the city but it's a very quite apartment. \n\nThanks Marcell!\n\nWe had a lovely time staying in this apartment. It is just as the pictures describe, and the location was perfect. It is right next to the train station, a small super market and a bus stop on all the main tour bus routes. \n\nThe apartment was spotlessly clean and comfortable, and in a beautiful building. It was quiet and peaceful inside as the windows open onto an internal light well, rather than the main road. \n\nMarcel was very helpful and informative, and was always quick to respond to messages. We would definitely recommend this apartment.\n\nThe apartment is very nice and clean like in the images, with a fully equipped kitchen and really good Wi-fi. The location is in the center of the city.  Marcell is a great host and he helped us with all the information we needed for our staying in Budapest.

The flat is in a great location (close to public transit and within walking distance of most major tourist attractions), and the pictures are accurate.  Akos was helpful and responsive to questions and we had no problems during the stay.\n\nGreat staying. Close to everything. Check in and out are easy. Other than the toilet is kinda old, and you get water on the bathroom floor bc the shower is in the bathtub. \r\n\r\nOverall really good listing, recommend. \n\nThis is a fantastically bright, spacious and comfortable flat, with steaming hot water for that amazing tub, underfloor heating for when you get out, and excellent wifi.  The location is very central, within easy walking distance of some of the main sights like the Jewish quarter and the Central Market, and very close to the main metro and tram lines.  Akos was super helpful and welcoming from the time we booked, for example arranging for a taxi to pick us up when he heard how late our flight was going to arrive.  We would definitely stay there again!\n\nEverything was great from check in to check out. Akos is very friendly.\n\nAkos was very helpful & courteous. We has a good time, it was a beautiful apartment. Spacious rooms and nice location. Everything was very close by , very key area in Budapest. We recommend Akos always\n\nThe apartment is very nice, great location near an area with many restaurants and cafes. The pictures are true, it is specious, clean and well equipped. Great value for the money, would recommend.  Host was easy to communicate with.\n\nReally great location, very central and close to all public transport. The apartment is perfect and clean and we enjoyed our stay. Highly recommended!!! \r\n\r\nAkos was very friendly and helpfull. :) Thank you!\n\nCommunicating with Akos is very easy! He replies quickly and helped us with some advise on how to get to the apartment easily and what are the nice places to visit in Budapest, he was also kind enough to let us leave the bag in the apartment while we wait for our train, while we didn't personally meet him, he was such a wonderful host. About the apartment, the design and feel is a bit rustic, you'll find some really old pieces in there which is both an advantage and disadvantage, the bath looks really nice but it has some cracks on it and it was a bit difficult to use it, there is indeed a problem with the drain as the bath smells weird, other than that everything in the apartment is exactly as in the photos, huge! Wifi is stable and they have english channels too! The street where the apartment is situated is filled with restaurants and shops and all the nice places to see are all walkable, metro is also just about 5 minutes away! We didn't have a problem looking for it.\n\nThe place is beautiful! It is even more so than in the pictures. We were absolutely smitten as soon as we arrived. Dealing with Akos was really easy and he was very warm. The location is perfect. You can walk everywhere and you are in a really interesting and accessible district.

And Emese were very nice and helpfull.\n\nThanks to Emese we had the best staying in Budapest possible! :) She is really a lovely person, easy to communicate with and very helpful.

Looking forward to my next stay in Budapest and I would definitely take into consideration staying in Emese's place again. Thank you, wish you all the best, xxx\n\nThe flat is very small, as you can guess by pictures. Although it is pretty comfortable, and very well located. The only thing is that it is really cold in the apartment and the heating is gas, so I found it a bit dangerous. Hot water is also a small problem, because you have to wait for it and the pressure in the shower is very low. Emese is very kind, answers every question and is very quick. For the cheap price it is a very good deal.\n\n\nEmese was a great host, she explained everything there is to know about Budapest, she also recommended events to attend. The apartment was great as well, it is positioned really good. All in all our stay was pleasant.\n\nWe loved staying at Emese's home! It is a great apartment and had everything we needed. Emese was very responsive to all our questions and needs. The apartment is very cute and cosy. So pleased with our stay there!\n\nI spent 4 fabulous days in Budapest and Emese's flat was like a second home to me. It's small but cosy and I loved getting comfy on the sofa by the gas fire in the evenings.\r\nEmese is a great communicator and was there when I arrived to welcome me and show me around. The flat is in a great location, with little shops and a supermarket for groceries, close to a shopping mall and if you're used to walking, you can get to the centre or to Margaret Island.\r\nWould definitely stay there again!\n\nEmese's apartment is a great choice when staying in Budapest. It has everything one might need. Also, Emese is a great host, who was kindly waiting for us in the apartment at our arrival and provided us with all information we needed. We definitely recommend staying at her place.\n\nEmese is really nice person, she gave us a feel like at our apartment. Everything was perfect - location, flat and also the host. \r\nI can highly recommend to stay at her and I hope that I get a possibility to be there again.

It's really close to a metrostation. But if you like to walk, it's very doable. Everything was clean and everything we needed was there. Gabor is a great host\n\nMajoros picked me up from the main Railway station (Keleti station). The whole arrival process went smoothly, and without any problems. The apartment is clean, comfortable, well equipped and very functional. \r\nThe only potential issue I could see would be for a person of limited mobility: The sleeping area of the apartment is on a loft. Loft is spacious and comfortable, and easily accessible by ladder. For a healthy adult, this is safe and functional solution. However, I could see that this could be an issue for an mobility-challenged person, or a young child. \r\nSummary: I highly recommend this place for healthy adults or persons traveling with bigger children, including business travelers. \r\nThere are two metro stations very close to apartment: one about 3 minutes walk from the apartment, another 8. Around the second -8 minutes walk - metro station is also a commercial area, with plenty of restaurants.  \r\n\n\nThe apartment is tiny but fully furnished (except there is no desk suitable for working at). The neighborhood is frequently described as a bit dodgy but apart from being more rundown than the very center, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. It's a five minute walk to the subway and trams. Communication, checkin and checkout were completely unproblematic.\n\nA lovely place, very nice host. Totally recommend \n\nAmazing experience. Loved every minute of it. Really good value, walking distance of everything!! What you see is what you get. \n\nGabor's apartment was perfect for our stay in Budapest. The location is great, and better than we had expected, with only a short walk to the centre and ruin bars. The apartment was clean, warm and we felt relaxed and at home immediately. Also the wifi is really fast so great if you fancy a night in.\n\nWould absolutely recommend to anyone. \n\nThanks Gabor!\n\nIts was like a hotel.\nThank you so much.\n\nMe and my boyfriend stayed in apartment for 3 nights. Apartment is very nice, tidy and right size for a couple. Gabor was such an amazing host. He answerd on all my 1000 questions and before we come he sent us all info about where we should go to eat,party etc. - very well organised man. \nEven that his apartment is not in the middle of the center u have subway station 3min away and can explore and walk around city anyway. And the good side of not being in center is peace during the night :) \nSo thank u Gabor once again for everything :) \nBest regards form Lake Bled, Slovenia\nNika and Dejan\n\nGabor's apartment is as shown in the pictures. It's very very clean, new, spacious and perfect for 2 or even 4 people. The only BUT we have is that the neightbourhood it's not the best one. At night, when we got back from dinner, there were some drug dealers and prostitutes. We didn't feel very safe or confortable walking around.\nDespite of this, we would like to thank Gabor for picking us up at the train station the first day, and for having the apartment in such good conditions. \n\nI loved staying at G\u00e1bors place. He was very kind and welcoming. He was very helpful; he provided us with maps, directions,  and extra page dedicated to extra non touristy places to visit. Any time we asked any questions he was quick to response. The place was clean and as perfect as in the pictures.

The apartment is clean, modern and stunning. It has a beautiful big bath, and was beautifully decorated for christmas. It is in the most amazing location - literally next to Buda Castle and the Chain bridge. Just 10 minutes walk to the city centre and two different traditional baths. Ildik\u00f3 and her husband were wonderful. They met us at the apartment - even though we checked in at 1am. They gave us maps, suggestions on where to go and what to do. They were warm and welcoming and left a bottle of Budapest champagne in the fridge! Cannot recommend this place highly enough - one of the best airbnb places we have stayed in. Thanks so much! \n\nWe had a wonderful stay at Ildiko's place. The apartment was clean and just as it looks in the pictures. Ildiko was very easy to get in touch with and was quick with any replies. The apartment has a great location and we wish we could have stayed longer! Would recommend this place to anyone staying in Budapest. Thank you\n\nIldik\u00f2 was very nice, helpful and understanding even though she speaks only a little English. She showed us the other entrance to the building, places to go like monuments, supermarkets, restaurants, and baths, and local food. She left fruit and a bottle of Hungarian champagne in the fridge! She tried to satisfy all our needs and replied quickly when we contacted her. The location is perfect, the Royal palace was right above us and only had to cross the Chain bridge to be in the heart of the city. We walked the whole time. Took public transport only to come and go from the airport. The house was clean and had many lights. It was charming and had everything we needed. Only drawbacks were: the only window had to be closed by curtains at all times to have some privacy (if you spend some time at home); the bathtub isn't as easy to enjoy as we imagined. Other than that the experience was great and we couldn't be happier! Thank you so much for the pleasant stay!!\n\nThe apartment was in a great location, within walking distance from all of the central tourist sites. Good size for two people, immaculately decorated and very clean. All the amenities you could ask for. Ildiko was great at communicating, and helped us with recommendations and places to visit in the city. Highly recommended.\n\nCharming apartment - perfect for single or couple;  located close to Chain Bridge - could walk everywhere we wanted to go!\n\nGreat location. You can walk everywhere. Quiet neighborhood but near the river and everything I wanted to photograph. I would highly recommend this apartment. \n\nWhat a stunning apartment, everything was perfect. Ildiko and her husband were so welcoming and friendly, they also gave us lots of tips and tourist info. If you have want to stay in Budapest book this place, location is amazing! Walking distance to everything that you would want to see! I would recommend 100%!\n\nlocation of the apartment is perfect, it just next to the Chain bridge and very close to most of the popular spots. I would like to say thank you to lldiko and her husband and I will strongly recommend to everyone to stay here when you come to Budapest.\n\nAmazing location, beautiful apartment and everything went smoothly. Really enjoyed our stay and the hosts were very helpful helping us find the place and making us feel welcome. \n\nPerfect stay in a perfect apartment thats in a perfect location. What more can i say? \n\nIldiko was very helpful upon arrival and made us feel very welcoming. \n\nOur stay in budapest was made to be a very easy one with all the amenities we required plus fast internet and netflix for us to use. \n\nOnly a short walk from many of the sights we wanted to see. \n\nI would definatly recommend staying here to any couples that wished to visit budapest.

We also thought there would be towels because it was written in the description, but we found instead two small towels just for hands or face, not so good for the shower. Furthermore the heating system was ok, but when we were cold and we didn't know how to turn it on, we asked fanni and she didn't reply. Just a little bit of comunication would have been appreciated. Anyway we had a great time in Budapest :)\n\nThe room was pretty comfy and spacious. As other have said it could be a bit cleaner, but it wasn't too bad. The location is pretty central and I really appreciated having a supermarket really closed by. \n\nNice room, all as described. Close to main road and shops but situated in a quieter street. Good value for this price range.\n\nFant\u00e1stico! Awesome place!\n\nFanni was very kind and helpful. The apt was great, it was clean and quiet. I have only one complaint - I don`t think shower was cleaned all over before we arrived and there was only one role of toilet paper. \r\nBut all in all definitely recommended. :)\n\nThis was one of my best experiences with AirBnB. Fanni was always accessible, and helpful with: recommendations, booking taxis and making your stay comfortable. If only she could cure my travel partner's snoring! \r\n\r\nThe room itself was of a high standard, and in excellent condition, especially for the price you pay. \r\n\r\nThe location is good, it's no more than a 15-minute walk to the Danube, and it's easy access to the ruin bars. Szimpla is a stones throw away, for example.\r\n\r\nAll in all a great stay and would definitely stay again next time I'm in Budapest! \r\n\r\n\n\nFanni met us at the outer door to the place we had booked and told us that there had been an accident in the bathroom that made the room uninhabitable. But not to worry she had another place for us not more than 10 minutes away. There was nothing really that we could do so we went with it and were shown a room in a fourth floor walk up with no elevator. The room seemed decent enough except that there was no bed frame - just two twin beds thrown on the floor with a pillow on each and what looked to be sheet folded at the foot of each bed. \r\n\r\nThe bathroom was not attached like it had said it would be in the accommodation we had signed up for and paid money for... \r\n\r\nIn our travel fatigue we just nodded to everything Fanni said and said yes this would work. Fanni gave us the keys and quickly departed. Upon further inspection of the room we noticed that in fact they were NOT two twin bed but one box spring and a very crappy mattress. And only one pillow and one pillow case stuffed with stuff. The sheets were not in fact sheets but duvet covers and the fitted sheets on the mattresses were actually mattress protectors. \r\n\r\nThe wifi would not work 70% of the time and the bathroom was not attached to the room. Furthermore many of the amenities (like a hairdryer) were not available here nor did Fanni offer to provide one. \r\n\r\nLuckily we spend much of our time exploring Budapest and only came back to sleep. Upon packing up our things the morning of check out we took the mattress protectors (or maybe they were very threadbare sheets?) off the beds and saw BUGS. Freaking out we were worried we would carry a bug-bed infestation back to our home but quickly ascertained they were not bed-bugs. NEVERTHELESS - for TWO NIGHTS we had been sleeping in bug infested beds. I received several bites but wrote them off as travel wounds and nothing to worry about. We should have been more observant when the sheets were on but like I said - we were only in the apartment to shower and sleep. Not a lot of time for observation. \r\n\r\nYou can bet next time we will be inspecting a room VERY CAREFULLY before agreeing that it is okay and we will NOT be recommending Fanni or her accommodations to any one. \r\n\r\nBOOK WITH CARE. You might not get what you paid for.

Everything is very clean and cosy. Apartment is very easy to find and it also has a great location for tourists - all touristic places are right here.\n\nFirst of all great location, perfect in my opinion. The room was large and all the facilities all worked. Our bed could have been more comfortable but location made up for it. We met one of the hosts briefly and he was delightful. We needed to leave our bags for a while on the last day and there was no problem - even let us hold on to the key so we could collect them when we were ready. \n\nEverything fine!\n\nThank you Peter\n\nThe apartment was clean and matched with the price, host was nice. The location of the flat is very good. One of the beds was not comfortable at all but for the money it was OK.\n\nWe really enjoyed our stay at Orsi's place. You cannot ask for a better location to stay in Budapest. You're right by the historic parliament building, less than 5 minutes to the metro and less than 2 to the trolley/bus stop. \nThe flat was kept very clean. With clean sheets and towels waiting for you. There are 3 rooms in the flat that they also rent out so know that you'll probably have roommates throughout your stay. In the room I stayed the bed was a futon of sorts, comfortable but still not a bed. For the price I would happily sleep on it again. \nWould stay there again. \n\nIf they haven't changed the ad yet, there is not a drier or hot tub. Just a drying rack and a regular bath tub. \n\nWalkway to the city, new kitchen and bathrooms. Good cleaning. Nice guests and host. It's a pitty with noice from tram.\nSmall tings to do. Put the washingmachine in level so it doesn't move, waterleakage under kitchen. Change my foam rubber mattress it is to thin to a normal man like me 90 kg.\n\nGood location and great host. I just personally think it's a little over priced for what it is. Over all a good experience though \n\nWe had a lovely stay at Orsi's place.

Sara's family helped me carry my bags down which was greatly appreciated - I would stay there again\n\nI would recommend this stay to everyone as it felt like being at home. Sara and her mother,Elisabeth, are both really nice, welcoming and helpful. Elisabeth is also a great host, I loved the breakfasts!\nIf I returned to Budapest, I would definitely love to stay with Sara's family again. \nPS Having a separate toilet and bathroom was also appreciated.\n\nWonderful place, everything was as described. S\u00e0ra meet me but her mother hosted me, she was very hospitality and helped me to experience the best Budapest.

It's slightly out of the main areas but has easy transport links that make it very quick and easy to get into town. Had a great stay and would highly recommend it!\n\nDaniel's apartment is so much MORE than it is on the pictures!\nIf you're a tourist and came to see Budapest's sights, I'd give you one warning... you won't want to leave this place and risk to spend hours sipping wine and admiring the best Parliament view in the city! :)\n\nThis was indeed the best place we've stayed in, and we want to thank Daniel and his father for their warm welcome and hospitality. We will come back!\n\nView was amazing!  Daniel and his mother were thoughtful and very helpful. Bed and pillows were a little hard for our taste but the view, convenient location, and ability to save money by cooking our own meals well made up for it. \n\nAbsolutely beautiful apartment in a handy location - we pretty much walked everywhere. Just like the pictures and the view is unbelievable! Daniel met us when we arrived and gave us lots of helpful information. All in all - superb!\n\nThe view and the apartment are stunning, but a few things needs to be improve. First we did not feel a warm welcome from the hosts, almost unwelcoming... Leaving a Czech beer in the fridge and  outdated chocolates as gifts are not really impressive either... The matress of the bed needs to be changed, it is used and we did not sleep well. We had no hot water for one complete day (building issue but still unpleasant). I would still recommend the place because it's a top choice for Budapest at that price but with small improvements it will reach perfection. \n\nWe love vacation rentals--Airbnbs---and others. This is now our favorite vacation apartment. It exceeded our expectations (and that is saying something because we are a bit obsessive!). Yes, we are the ones, like you, digging through all of the possibilities, reading all of the reviews, looking at all of the pictures, trying to make the right choice. If you are considering this apartment, choose it. The location, the VIEW, the beautiful space, the fabulous balcony, the VIEW, the washer/dryer, the beer on arrival, the VIEW, the looking across the Danube and seeing the seeing the bats over the Parliament at night, the lift, the very reasonable price, every room tastefully decorated, and the VIEW! And if you are wondering about Budapest, choose it! We loved every minute. We can't wait to go back. When looking online we always wonder if the photos accurately represent the apartment. In this case the pictures don't do justice to the place. Amazing.\n\nThe apartment is located within close proximity from the batthyany ter metro and tram station, it's very convenient to use the public transport to explore the city. Daniel has also helped us to book a cab to the airport on our last day which it's much appreciated!\n\nAs me and my partner got to the apartment we were greeted by Daniel and his father who showed us around the apartment. Everything was new and modern. The view is incredible! Unfortunately I became ill over the period of our stay and the host was great by helping me get medication and making me feel at ease which was lovely as nobody likes being ill in another country! We had everything we needed at our doorstep, shops, pharmacy, bus stop, the hustle and bustle 15 mins away and you can never get lost as you know your apartment is opposite the parliament! It was very handy. Recommend! \n\nThis apartment has the most beautiful scene I've ever been to\n\nAfter spending 6 weeks in Europe using Airbnb we left the best until last. This place is amazing and the location is perfect. \nOn arrival we were met by the boys and they settled forums in and helped us with a map and some info. At the end of our stay they allowed us to leave our luggage in the apartment and booked us a taxi as we had an evening flight. \nThere is a great supermarket nearby and plenty of restaurants close.

The apartment has a living room and 2 bedrooms, one of them is offered for you to stay.  \n\nThe apartment is on the top (3rd) floor of a 1960's building and it was renovated recently. There's no elevator. The apartment is on a hill and it has a balcony with a stunning panoramic view over the city and the surrounding hills.\n\nThe sunlit apartment has an equipped kitchen with fridge, washing-machine, oven, gas stove, toaster, coffee machine, mixer (...and everything you need to cook). You can also use WiFi, cable TV, home cinema sound system and anything you need and I have (hairdryer, iron). I'll provide you linen and towels, slippers too.\n\nI am a freelance graphic designer, so I'm quite flexible with my time. During the day I usually come and go, working home or having several meetings in the city. In the evenings I meet my friends or do some private programs away from home and most nights I don't sleep at home, so I will give you a lot of privacy. But if you are interested in conversations with me or a dinner together, I'm also open to it, since I'm friendly and talkative. :) I can give you tons of recommendations and provide you with several flyers, booklets, magazines about programs and highlights of the city, and I'm also ready to go out and show you around if you like and I can find time. I truly believe that connection with other people makes our life richer and more meaningful. Sharing is caring - it's my motto.\n\nThe neighborhood is very safe and comfortable, one of the most precious areas in the city: fresh air, lots of greens, parks, walking and hiking trails and panoramic views, while the city center is only 10 minutes and the connection is excellent even at night. Although it is a relaxed area, you will find here some restaurants, wine bars, an English speaking cinema, a sport complex with swimming pool and gym, supermarket, shopping center and every Saturday there is a farmers' market, where you can get organic fruits and vegetables, cheese, dairy, meat, wine, etc.\n\nThe apartment is easily accessible 24/7 with public transport, but taxi transfer is also an affordable option. (It costs only 6-8 euros from the center.) \n\nMost highlights of Budapest are very easy to reach:\n- Gell\u00e9rt Hill / Citadella - 10 min\n- Buda Castle (Royal Palace, Funicular, National Gallery, Budapest History Museum, Fisherman's Bastion - 15 min\n- River Danube / Duna Corso - 10 min\n- Rudas Bath - 10 min\n- Gell\u00e9rt Bath - 15 min\n- City Center - 10-15 min\n\nI have a cat in the apartment.

First of all we were staying in a different place than it was shown on the pictures. Very small bedroom, perfect for two but still I was expecting something else. Second thing - it was smelly, because obviously there is a problem with heating system. After we turned off the heater smell of gas was gone and it still was pretty warm inside. There are lots of good things about this flat: perfect location, friendly host, very atmospheric flat with a very nice view, old but again very authentic house. I can call this experience a good one and I would totally stay there again. Thank you!\n\nComfy flat int the center, our host is a really nice person.\r\nI recommend the accommodation.\n\nReally nice appartement, very very well situated. Tha appartement is clean and exactly as described on Airbnb.\r\nAdrian is a really nice host who did everything to make me feel as home in Budapest, and waited me for the keys because of taxi strike (i was in late).\r\nIf i have to come back in Budapest i will probably book this appartement again.\n\nThis apartment was wonderful! The location could not be better, right in the center of everything and walking distance to all major landmarks in Budapest. Communication was simple, and Adrian had someone wait outside for me when I arrived to help me get into the apartment. Though it was snowing outside, the heater worked very well and it did not take long to heat the entire room. The space was wonderful, and it was nice having a fridge (though we did not use the rest of the kitchen). The water in the shower was great; I've had places where it got cold quickly but that did not happen here. This was a great value, and I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone planning to visit Budapest for a few days.\n\nI am very grateful to Adrian whom I couldn't meet in person but sent a friend who then again was extremely helpful. The rooms seem to be a bit smaller than they are on photos,you must open the window due to enormous chloride smell when you arrive.I even had to take a pill against headache.still I say that I got a good place in the heart of the downtown at a very affordable price.thanks\n\nAdrian was a nice host, the flat is really convenient for a short stay in budapest as you will not need to walk more than 5 minutes to all the great places in Pest!! A very nice experience here.\n\nGreat location and Adrian picked us up from the airport which was convenient.\r\n\r\nA few things were disappointing; the flat is on the 4th floor with no lift. I don't remember reading this in the description. The bed was not especially comfortable and the linens provided were insubstantial. The towels smelled like cigarettes.\r\n\r\nAgain, the location was made this place worth staying 3 nights, but my husband and I were glad to move on to another location.\n\nAdrian was a great host. Perfect location and nice apparment. We liked it there very much, we surely will be going back.\n\nAlmost everything was good, expect from the keys (some problems with locking/unlocking the door), but altogether I can say it was great. The quality rapported to the price is excellent! \n\nLocation of the apartment is great, it's close to the city center and metro stations (M3, M4). Adrian was good host, he came at scheduled time and he explained everything about apartment. Apartment is very good for staying a few days, but it's not recommended to stay any longer.

It was exactly what we needed. Perfect location, spacious and clean. Luca was also very helpful! Would recommend to everyone!\n\nLuca was very responsive and accommodating. The neighborhood was absolutely perfect for our tourist weekend and felt very safe. The photos on the website are deceiving, but I still think the place was great. I thought that the hosts would be more involved in telling us about things to do in Budapest, but they had a pretty long list of recommendations in a book inside the apartment so that was helpful. Overall this was a fun experience and I would definitely recommend it to others. Just make sure you take warm showers before you get there, because there is no warm water anywhere except the thermal baths across town.\n\nAbsolutely perfect for a Budapest-Trip with a few friends.\nGreat apartment, very well located.\nCheck-In and Check-Out totally uncomplicated.\n\nGood location but the house not very well equipped as water and tissues\nBut in conclusion it is good\n\nGreat neighbourhood, nice balcony. Quiet appartment in nice building. \r\nPity the dishwasher did not work. \n\nLocation is very convenient next to a tram stop and a metro station at the Parliament house which is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Budapest. We had a rental car, and parking garage was located only a couple of blocks away.\r\nBudapest is a beautiful place to visit. The hosts were very accommodating and allowed us to check-in already at noon.\r\nArt House was a good base to explore the sights in Budapest.\r\nAlso, a very good restaurant \"Hungarian Bistro\" was nearby. Please note, table reservation is needed. The place is that busy.\r\nOne comment about the apartment: it is located on the third floor and the elevator did not work. For us it was no problem, but for some it could be.\r\n\r\n \n\nOutstanding location: right next to Danube and the beautiful Parliament building. Many restaurants and boat cruises nearby. Chain Bridge, Buda Castle, and St. Stephan's Cathedral are a short walk away. Not too far from the train station either. 2-3k Forints should be sufficient for taxi.\n\nThe host is very helpful and accommodating: allowed us to check in early and recommended an excellent restaurant nearby.\n\nOne minus was the age of the apartment, but that's expected for the price.\n\nWe werent met by Dora or Luca in the end but the colleGue who met us was wonderful.  She told us everything we needed, made sure we had no more questions and that we knew how to contact if there were any problems.  She was there when she said and made us feel welcome.  \r\n\r\nLocation is fabulous, particularly as its a quieter neighbourhood at night.  Easy to get to the tram right nearby and the underground station.  A market for necessities just on the road.  All in all a fabulous visit!\n\nSpacious apartment situated in a beautiful location with a great view of the Danube river on the balcony - the apartment was 2 minutes walk from parliament building. Local supermarkets and restaurants are a short walk away and close access to the bus, tram and metro stations. Dora and her friend made us feel very welcome and were available for any questions throughout our stay. \n\nThis is a beautiful, huge flat located round the corner from the Houses of Parliament. The balcony extends the length of the flat and is actually a lot larger than the photo showed. There is a view of the Danube from the balcony!

The appartment isn't exactly located in the city centre but it is only two stops away by the underground.

We loved our stay at this appartment. Thank you!\n\nBeautiful apartment! Would highly recommend the transfer to and from the airport, was so handy! \nBudapest was the prettiest city we had been to and going back to this apartment was just the cherry on top :) cannot give enough praise! \n\n\nI didn't have any problems with the host, he's very nice and if you need something he's there at the moment.

The apartment and room is exactly like on the pictures. The room is big with also big windows (enough light coming in). The wifi was great in the flat. The shower was great with a rainshower and good hot water. The location of the apartment was also great. The late check-in and check out organised with no issues. The apartment is stylish, homely, and generally beautiful. I have stayed in several places I would rate 5/5 through Air BnB, but the quality of Edits' apartment, and the effort she puts into making the Budapest experience unforgettable, make Edit the standard against which other hosts should be judged. \r\nTruly an amazing experience that I would recommend without hesitation.\r\n\r\nOverall I felt home in this apartment and its a great place to start your day from this location!\n\nThis accommodation was wonderful; we we're able to arrange a private pick- up from the airport, and the apartment was beautiful and spotless. Great location in the heart of Buda. Great service all around, would definitely recommend.\n\nEdit is an amazing and friendly host. So helpful, shared some great tips with us about visiting the city. Responds to all texts and messages immediately.

Great location in Budapest, easy to walk around or use public transportation. The apartment has all the commodities and is extremely clean.

Extremely quiet despite being very central. \n\nFabulous little flat, well designed and perfect for a visit to the city. Would definitely recommend! \n\nWe've had a lovely stay at Vitalis' appartment. It was very clean. All basic needs were present. What we really loved was that his place was near the state opera and 10 min walk from the city centre (vorosmart ter). We only had to walk a few minutes to get to the nearest metro. In the neighbourhood you have a couple of good restaurants and down the street you got a some caf\u00e9s. It made Budapest a wonderful experience.\r\n\r\nGreetz from Emmanuel and Sanne (Belgium)\n\nVery nice place to stay with family. Clean, wonderful location, spacious flat. My family really enjoyed staying at Vitalis'.\n\nVitalis was the perfect host even though we never actually met. He reacts to AirBnB-Messages within seconds and provided all the necessary information for check-in and check-out at exactly the time needed. He was flexible before our stay (I had a changing request which prompted a simple \"no problem\") and made sure all was well during our stay.\r\nThe appartment is cozy, well equipped and clean. There's a fully equipped kitchen which we did not use (too many good restaurants around the corner). Even though it is marketed as one bed room, there is some degree of privacy between the two double beds (no sight contact, second bed in a kind of small attic a few steps up the stairs).\r\nThe location is pretty much perfect, close to public transportation, restaurants and small shops.\r\nExtra points for the super beautiful and original (though sadly unrestored) 1900s or 1890s courtyard in the building!\n\nWonderful place in a great location. Perfect for couples- highly recommended. \n\nVitalis was an excellent host from start to finish. He welcomed us into the apartment and provided all the necessary instructions and recommendations to make our stay pleasant and stress-free. The convenient location made it easy to get to all the city's main attractions. Would stay again!\n\nThe place was perfect and as described. Location is great and central to everything. Vitalis provided detailed instructions and checked in with us throughout the stay. Had a wonderful time in Budapest and highly recommend this bnb, you won't regret it!!\n\nEverything was wonderful! The apartment was spectacular and very comfortable. It's also within walking distance to everything! I would definitely stay there again. Vitalis was very nice and accommodating.\n\nVitalis was most accommodating and his communication, right from the word go, was excellent. When we needed advice he was more than happy to guide and recommend. The apartment is warm, welcoming and has everything one needs for a city break, including heating/ AC, coffee machine, hairdryer, iron, tv and radio. \r\nThere are guide books/ maps and on the 2 blackboards there are some top tips for places to visit, as well as bars and restaurants. Along with this there is also a visitors book, where previous guests pop their top tips in too. No need to take towels if you're NOt planning on visiting one of the spars( we used ours for the spars) as they also proved towels etc. \r\nIt's in a fantastic location as you are right in the heart of Pest, within a 5 minute walk of some excellent night life, with the opera house less than 2 minutes away. The Opera house is on Andrassy Ut, which happens to be where all the tour buses stop too. So you really couldn't be in a better spot, and although your on the doorstep to some main attractions, it's really quiet in the apartment, so you can sleep well too.

The bicycles were great, we only had a day so we were able to zoom round the city on the many dedicated cycle tracks. There was safe parking nearby. We were right next to the Gellert baths, which looked amazing and we wish we had had more time to visit. The stairs were fine for us...wide with plenty of places to stop for breath. Thank you Gabor and Kata for a fantastic couple of days in Budapest.\n\nWhat a wonderful place Gabor has to stay in.  He met us as we were walking up to the street from the metro. He was very nice and quick to respond to any questions about getting around town. We also liked the fact that he let us use the bikes to get around on.\n\nGabor's flat is very pretty and clean, you can find everything you need. It is located in a perfect position to visit Budapest, I reccomend it, if I will come back to Budapest I will surely contact him!\n\nGabors place is beautifull and well situated. I would recommend his appartment to everyone whos in the search of an well equipped cosy place.\n\nDefinitely one of the best airbnb's places I've ever been. The flat is great, clean, well located and beautiful. G\u00e1bor and Kata are the perfect hosts. They helped us so much that I don't have words to thank them. No doubt that I'll stay here again in my future visit to Budapest.\n\nAlthough I never met Gabor, his wife was at the property to greet me. Everything was correct and as advertised. The apartment was clean and decorated with taste and great care. The endless stairs made for perfect exercise, coming and going. A great way to work off the delicious and abundant Hungarian food. The location was close to everything. All in all, a great choice. I would love return to this place and would recommend it without hesitation.\n\nGabor was waiting outside of his property upon my arrival and made sure I was comfortable and well-acquainted both with his property and the area around it. The apartment was very clean and, for being a bit small, really utilized its space well. I expect to get back to Budapest in the near future and hope to stay here again.\n\nWe can warmly recommend to rent this apartment. The pictures are not lying and it was cleaned up nicely. It was also really cozy and neighbourhood was quiet and on nice location just next to Gellert's spa. Two bikes were also included to the rent which we found a nice way to explore the city. The host was friendly and helpful. We could also see that he had also put a lot of effort to make our staying in their apartment comfortable.\n\nIt was a pleasure to once again spend some time in Kata & Gabor\u00b4s apartment! This is the second time I have stayed at the Minilux apartment and it will sure be more times. \r\nThe apartment is clean, cosy, has cable TV, a bike you can borrow, a nice comfortable big bed and kitchen with all the stuff you'll need (and also very nice hosts!). It is nice to spend time there and relax.\r\nI highly recommend this apartment, you will not be disappointed!\n\nThanks to Gabor for a great week in Budapest. He is really a great host and always ready to help. \nApartment is super nice and comfortable. It is close to everything thanks to great location. All the description is 100% true. I've got everything i had planed.

The flat is in a supersafe area,there is a Micheline star restaurant in the area, buses, trams and metro nearby. You can feel that you are in Buda :) The flat was very clean, had a lovely coffee machine,utensils, plates. We had a great stay there specially  at Christmas time. Thank you very much for having us again :):) \n\nVery nice apartment. We stayed there for three nights and all was well. The communication with Ildik\u00f3 and her friend Steven ran all smoothy via Email and (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). Even though we arrived very late they managed to leave the keys in a save place so we could pick them up and get in without any trouble. \n\n3 of us spent 5 nights in this place and it was a great place to come home and relax in! It was in a quiet neighborhood but the bus stop was near by and it didn't take too long to get to the city center! We did do a bit of cooking in the house and found it a bit difficult as it was a quite small kitchen with few pots, tools, etc. \nThe house is cute and has a few quirks, as most do but still a great little place! The Wifi was good and we liked the cafe across the street. \n\nI stayed at Ildika's apartment along with my husband and two kids and concidering that this was our first time experiencing AIRBNB we are more than happy. The pictures of the apartment are true to their word, it is well furnished (we ourselves didn't do any cooking so I'm not certain about the kitchen equipment). The place was clean, warm and although somewhat small, the place was very well organised. The kids absolutely loved the bed - gallery. We truly felt as at home. Although it's not in the centre of the city, public transport took us with speed and ease. Nearby, aproximetly 5 min walk, there is a bus and trollycar station hence we didn't have to go by our car at all. The neighborhood is tranquil and we felt safe. Communicating with the host was excellent, when we called to say we arrived earlier than planned they offered to let us into the apartment before the original time and we were very greatful for that. Also nearby, as was stated, there are free parking spaces so we parked our car there. Over the weekend (when parking is free) we had our car right in front of the building. All in all it was a great experience, we hope to visit again come springtime.\n\nThe flat is nice and cozy in a nice, quiet, family friendly area. Everything you might need during your stay is provided. A dodgy wall socket and a flimsy kitchen tap where the only two things that needed to be fixed, and the flat could use some extra cutlery and a decent kitchen knife, however that's just being picky, otherwise the flat is fantastic! Enjoyed our stay and looking forward to coming back to Budapest once again!\n\nWonderful flat in a very calm location. Public transport is nearby, just 5 mins of walking.\n\nI had very good time at ildiko's apartment.\r\nVery confortable and clean\n\nWe had a great time at Ildiko\u00b4s apartment. It is really a lovely place for couples or a families with one child. It took us a 20 minutes walk to get to the city center, which was totally fine for us.\n\nWe really enjoyed our stay at the small studio! It was cozy and well decorated. Quite limited kitchen supplies (no cooking knives and chopping board...) but other than that it was very comfortable staying there. Both the sofa bed and mezzanine bed were comfortable. Parking can be a bit tricky as there is a limited free parking space but parking is free at night and also it's not that expensive so no problem there. \n\nVery nice apartment in a nice area (not the central one, but very quiet residental area with a good cafe across the street). Good communication with hosts. The bed is actually a platform, so there is not too much space above the head.

Metro Station V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty ter is just few steps away while De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r (which is the only transfer station) is also right in the corner.\n\n\nVery cozy and interesting place and was perfect for me travelling alone. I really felt compfortable.\nDefinitely recommend it! :)\n\nPerfect place, perfect location.\n\nAndi and Anett where unable to be there to check us in however she sent clear instructions and photos of how to get into the apartment. The location is fantastic right in the middle of the square with just a short walk to everything and the apartment was very clean. The only thing that let it down were the pillows were scatter cushions with a sheet over it. But other than that great little apartment for a few days away. \n\nThe apartment is really cozy and little, exactly how it looks at the pictures. It is in an excellent location, near the main attractions, metro, restaurants and stores. We would return for sure, even though the elevator was broken and at night there are some homeless people sleeping near the door. Andi was very nice with us, sending all the information before and answering our questions in time.\n\nThe location of this apartmant is unbelievable. Everything is so close! Highly recommend for everone who would like to enjoy a vacation in a nice small apartment in the most beautiful city I have ever been to. \nJust one thing. The apartment has a rather steep staircase leading to it. So people with limited ability to move may have problems getting up.\n\nThe apartment is in a great location especially for exploring the buda side, there are heaps of nice food places around too. The apartment is cozy and well equipped and a really nice space to relax after exploring all day \n\nAndi and Anett was fantastic and helpful. For me it's the best location in Budapest, very well situated for visiting, shopping, night life .. I was there with my son for two weeks and we had a very nice holidays. \n\nThe apartment was Perfect!! We stayed in Budapest three nights and loved it all the time. The flat is great located and it is near to everything in  the centre. Walk distance to great restaurants, shopping streets, grocery stores, tourist attractions and Donau! Andi was a great host and answered all our questions quickly! She met us to give us the key and showed us the apartment and told us what we needed to know! Wonderful!\n\nWe really enjoyed our stay at this cozy little flat. The location was superb with the main shopping street just around the corner and plenty of wonderful restaurants to choose from within few blocks. The flat is small but had everything we needed for our stay. The bed was a sofa bed but was surprisingly comfy though maybe not the best for longer stays and the kitchen was adequately equipped for cooking simple things. The flat was clean and the hosts were lovely, always answering our questions quickly and helping us with everything. We wholeheartedly recommend staying here!

It was a very smooth check-in, and communication was great. You can walk to centre Pest, but it is a long walk. However, Keleti train station and a number of buses and trams are 5 min away, and we had a very good experience with Budapest's public transportation. There's a supermarket on the same road and bakeries and other food spots around the area. The building is quite old and showing signs of needing a bit of work, but from what I saw that's common in Budapest. The apartment was clean, warm, and had everything we needed. The kitchen was decently equipped. The bathroom was clean. The bed was ok - the mattresses were a little thin. Overall it was a pleasant experience.\n\nThe flat was really nice and clean, also very close to the city centre. The host was helpful, hope I can stay there again.\r\nThank you.\n\nVery nice. The place is exactly as shown in the picture. Very close to the subway station and you can take a longer walk to the city centre if you want.\n\nThe apartment is exactly as shown in the photos. Very spacious and sunny (even in the winter!). All amenities needed for a short city break and even for longer stays. Fabio was an excellent host, getting in contact during our stay and the arrival process was also very smooth. \r\nClose to the train/metro station and buses to the center, easy to reach. Walking distance (apt 25 min to the city centre) and 15 min (Jewish Quarter). Will definitely recommend this flat for a Budapest City Break! \n\nit was so nice and awsome house! the interior was exactly the same with the photos. me and my friend was very satisfied to stay in Fabio's flat. we couldn't meet Fabio, because he wasn't in budapest so we met his friend instead him. and he was also very kind and good :) * Fabio gave answer to us very quick ^^ * He didn't make us to wait for a long time and that was really great! i recommend this house for sure :D\n\nI had an amazing stay at this place. It was extremely clean and I was able to cook and do laundry easily. The train station is about 2 mins away and it was extremely simple to get everywhere. Thanks so much for a great stay in Budapest!\n\nwell located apartment. cozy, clean, and perfect for 3 people.  it comes with all commodities. i will recommend it for all my friends who will want to visit Budapest. \n\nAll was good !we are very satisfied !i love Budapest!:D\n\nFabio and Natalie weren't able to let us in to the apartment and so their friend Bence did. He was running late and so kept us waiting outside for about 30 minutes but once he arrived he was very helpful and friendly.

The apartment was lovely and the room we stayed in was quite spacious. The location was perfect for us to catch the metro or go shopping at the mall 100m away. I would definitely stay here again!!\n\nAttila was very committed to providing a positive experience for us. He was flexible with our arrival and informative for recommendation in Budapest. When we left, he was very authentic and sincere in asking us our opinion of his home and how other tenants might feel during their stay. I really appreciated the ambiance. It felt like we were in someone's home, not in a hotel. \n\nAttila war super informative about location and additional information. The place was very nice and I would definetly recommend him!\n\nAttila was a gracious host.  He came down to meet us in the lobby and help with the luggage.  The room we occupied was spacious,  clean and comfortable.  All the necessary amenities were available to us.  However, he was upset that a previous airbnb tenant had damaged one of the large windows in the 100-year old building, and he had not had the opportunity to attend to the repairs.  The damage did not affect our comfort. When we left, Attila again helped with the luggage  and accompanied us all the way to the metro station.  This was a great deal of help, as our luggage was heavy and cumbersome.  I highly recommend    booking with Attila.\n\nAttila was very nice and welcoming.  His apartment is very big and Hungarian like. It would be good to stay here to see a traditional Hungarian apartment.  The location of hia flat is very good and in the middle of all the action.

Attila made our stay in Budapest great!\n\nAttila is a great host to familiarize with Hungarian culture. He had great tips about what to see in the city and also a very hospitable person. We enjoyed reading his book 'Philosophy of Love' that gives you an insight on his ideas what community could entail in sharing space. The apartment sites in a beautiful building, and is located in a part of town with a lot of of gems, that you can discover through a nice walk in the neighborhood.

Great location, which is perfect to discover Budapest. You can walk to the city centre in about 20 minutes, or the tube station is about 3 minutes\u2019 walk away. The house is easy to find and is conveniently located near the city centre. There's plenty of tram nearby. Beautiful old Art Deco building: the apartment block is a very typical Budapest 'udvar' (courtyard) block in the Art Nouveau style, built around 1905. It has a lot of character. Apartment is on the third floor and is a bit of a climb. The apartment has a lived-in, 'bohemian' feel to it. Don't expect a gleaming flat with IKEA furniture. There is also a very well behaved, quiet little dog and two lodgers, but it didn't feel crowded or noisy. The whole place was quiet and peaceful and the general feeling is a well-run postgraduate flat-share.\n\nI'am working at home, so I can help if you ask.\n\nCorvin, the City, Danube -everything is safe", "weekly_discount": "14%", "gym": false, "internet": false, "kitchen": true, "lift": false, "suitable_for_events": true, "air_conditioning": false, "name_of_district": "", "hair_dryer": true, "pool": false, "essentials": true, "hangers": true, "wheelchair_accessible": false, "host_description": "", "accuracy_rating": 10, "shampoo": false, "heating": true, "longitude": "19.071937581388806", "extra_people_charge": "\u20b4133 / night after the first guest", "url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7161970", "pets_allowed": true, "dryer": false, "cleaning_fee": "\u20b4134", "cancellation_type": "Flexible", "iron": true, "h24_check_in": false, "cleanliness_review": 8, "photo_urls": ["https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/90856129/d973f7e0_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/90856289/89e51c9e_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/90856270/a2a5577d_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/90856312/33cd24f7_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/90856329/aa064262_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/034ceaa7-9afe-4140-9cd5-8ca852313316.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/60685b9e-a01c-4ee9-add0-0f4187a02163.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7db7c307-1760-4f78-a670-9bdb7685d685.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/472a950d-44ab-498b-a081-c4b52500302e.jpg?aki_policy=small"], "smoking_allowed": false, "room_type": "Private room", "wireless_internet": true},

The kitchen and apartment were great. Thank you so much for the brownies and breakfast sandwiches! Hopefully we'll be in Budapest again soon. \n\nOur stay was great! Would definitely recommend Emy & Pete's place. They were the most generous, helpful and nice hosts. They picked us up from the station when we arrived late and cooked delicious food for us.

We fit four comfortably and Frida and Andrea were perfect hosts. \n\nThey were very easy to reach and super flexible. Our bus was 1 hour late and they were ok with it. Also they let us check out a little later.\n\nThe apartment's location was perfect, just in the Jewish quarter. Good bars and restaurants nearby.\n\nI really recommend it!\n\nVery good location and very convenient apartment. All the amenities worked well for us. \n\nThe apartment was ok, it look s little bit better in the pictires than it does in real life, but what you see is what you get. I lacks a little maintainance (shades did not work in main room). Location is excelent, only minutes from Sant Stephen Basilica, metro stations and other important tourist places. Also a lot of restaurants and bars very close, we loved to be able to enjoy Buspest night life at walking distance. The building itself where the apartment is needs some renewal, nevertheless we felt save. \n\nCould not be better located, very nice area, the flat is at a walking distance from everything in the heart of the city. \r\nFlat is fully equiped with everything you need although not as bright as in the pictures. \r\nOverall a good quality / price.  \r\nAlso if you need a ride to the airport, frida's friend peter is of very good service !

There was a small issue with the shower that was quickly fixed. I appreciate Vilmos fixing the issue very fast it was like it never even happened. The location of his apartment is absolutely perfect. Beautiful view of the Parliament. Bed is very comfy. Smart TV! I highly recommend staying at this apartment! Thank you Vilmos and thank you Brigatta for an unforgettable experience!\r\n\n\nOur experience was absolutely fantastic. Just like the pictures, clean & overlooking Buda Castle.\r\nBrigitta met us and gave us the key and the codes to the building, and there was beer, bread, milk, water, and other goodies left for us. There is also a Nespresso which is a pleasant surprise!\r\nWe would definitely stay here again! Thank you for being such a great host, Vilmos!\n\nPerfect location, reliable host. We enjoyed staying at Vilmos' place. Well equipped and highly recommended apartment!\n\nNice place and beautiful landscape !\nJuste a bit hard to communicate with the person in charge ( daughter).\n\nIt was a fantastic apartment  First we were afraid that the lift might not work.  But it worked well. Apartment is fabulous Internet is fast and the host provided a fresh loaf of bread, Milk Tea Coffee and even a couple of beers. We never used them though. \n\nThis location is great to stay in Budapest, quiet neighborhood but close to the metro and many attractions in Budapest, can't beat it. Villas was a great host, a bit of trouble checking in but everything was smoothed out after and was attentive when he away overseas. \n\nEverything was perfect. The apartment is full of every extra equipment (like nespresso capsules), is clean, the view is beautiful and it has a great position. Higly reccomended\n\nAmazingly beautiful apartment. We were shocked at the value for money- fantastic!!!\n\nVilmos place is a real gem for the business traveler and the tourist alike. \r\nI travel often (3 times/yr) to Budapest for work and location is very important since I use public transportation.  Batthy\u00e1ny t\u00e9r hub, a block away, with access to bus, metro and H\u00e9v makes ideal. I was actually staying at a hotel also a block away for years for that reason. The grocery store is a block and fruit shop, coffee shop and convenience store right outside! The Mammut mall is one subway stop (or 10min walk), 3-4 nice restaurants around the corner and for tourists, walk to the Castle district on 2 metro stops to Pest side Vaci Utca.\r\nThe apartment itself is in an older building, the entrance and the elevator not so fancy and difficult to find parking if you need. \r\nIt's an IKEA showcase (but the good IKEA), newly renovated in very fashionable way (I'm an architect) with a quirky bed platform design. That may be my only doubtful part since I get up from the bed 2-3 times at night. \r\nThe rest absolutely perfect! Water & some snacks available, squeaky clean, nice view from the little balcony over the Parliament, efficient and quiet mini split a/c, smart TV (bring your own Netflix account!), beautiful small restroom, the smell of new appliances, dishes, utensils.\r\nI will stay again in November.\n\nThe place is right across the parliament building and as the flat is on the top floor, you can see the parliament from the flat. \n\nLocation is 2 min walk from a metro station (and this station is only 2 stations away from the central station you have to get off when coming from the airport).\n\nThe place is very nice and modern, and the host is so kind to have prepared few bottles of water and nespresso capsules upon your arrival.\nYou get the whole place by yourself which was great as well.\n\nI will definitely come back!\n\n\n\n", "accommodates": "4", "spa": "", "breakfast": true, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 1PM", "availability": "2 nights minimum stay", "host_reviews": "25", "beds": "2", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/43819592", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": false, "review_summary": "My Beautiful Newly renovated Studio apartment is close to Buda Castle, F\u00e9ny utcai piac, Wasabi Running Wok & Sushi \u00c9tterem, Sir Lancelot Lovagi \u00c9tterem, .

They will make you feel very comfortable and give a lot of advice on what to do in Budapest. Their place is very close to transportation and getting to the main city center. They continued to check-in with us throughout our trip and explained the house rules very clearly. They are both very kind people and made our stay in Budapest quite lovely!\n\nVictor and his wife are absolutely lovely people.They are really friendly and helpful.\r\nVictor knows a lot about the city and knows how to get everywhere around and what is worth to visit.\r\nThe neighbourhood is peaceful and quiet,there is absolutelly no reason to be afraid go somewhere during the evening and night.\r\nWe really enjoyed staying in this flat. And we will definitely recommend to stay here to everybody,who would like to visit Budapest.\r\nThank you.\n\nAbsolutely enjoyed staying at Victor's and Judith's. It is a basic roomwith nothing fancy but the two of them are just top-notch hosts. Very nice and friendly people, extremely attentive and easy to talk to. They'll help ypu out with anything on your trip if you need tips or advice. The extremely beautiful neighbourhood right in the middle of Buda does its part.\r\nI can only recommend to stay there.\n\nVictor and his wife were absolutely lovely and very helpful, we really felt as home in their flat. Victor gave us many advices about the city and also helped is with transport Sistema information. The flat is very comfortable, the room was clean, comfortable bed, warm and quite. Location the best! We couldn't be in a better place close to the main places in the city, in fact I just took public transport in my arrival and my depart, always we reached everything by foot. It was one of the best airbnb  we have been! Thank you very much! \n\nWe liked the stay at Victor'splace. He and his wife are hospitable hosts, warm and communicative. Location is perfect. If we come again, we will s choose one of his apartments. That's for sure! Victor is great for giving advice, recommendation of places to visit.\n\nVictor and his wife were amazing hosts! Their apartment is in a great location. They provided lots of information about Budapest upon our arrival and told us the best ways to get around the city. They made our trip to Budapest so much better! Would definitely stay here again! \n\nWe arrived in Budapest on October 11th, around 1:30 pm. We had no difficulty locating our accommodations as, Victor provided us with very clear directions to reach his flat and a local gentleman we met on the Metro, very kindly escorted us to the very corner of the street we needed to reach the flat. It was an easy walk from the station. Although, some may find the uphill walk might leave you a bit winded, we are both in our mid-50's and had no difficulty. Also, the flat is on the third floor and there is no elevator in the buildings, which would be of concern to some, particularly if you have heavy luggage or several bags to carry up and back down when leaving. \n\nWe were very warmly welcomed by Judith.  Who showed us to our room for us to stow our bags. They had upgraded us at no additional charge to their larger double room, closer to the bath. She also showed us the WC and the kitchen. She let us know the water on tap was safe to drink and offered us coffee, tea or a glass of water. We gladly accepted large, refreshing glasses of water.  In spite of Judith's warning that her English was not so good, we felt she communicated well. We had no difficulty understanding her or making ourselves understood. She asked us our plans for the remainder of the day, and provided us with a quick summary of tourist highlights and how best to get around. We retired to our room for a quick nap to recuperate from our journey. \n\nThe room was bright with natural light from a large window overlooking a garden courtyard. The curtains darkened the room enough to sleep during the day. While the flat is not new, it is very clean and provided good value for the money. We did find it chilly, but the cold whether had arrived earlier than usually expected and the building's heating system had not yet been turned on. Our hosts apologized and promptly provided us with extra blankets that allowed for a comfortably warm slumber. It is a very quiet building, where we were able to relax peacefully after our day exploring the city. Being from Canada, we had experienced similar heating issues in rental accommodations, where tenants are at the landlord's discretion as to when the heat is turned on, usually as late as the law allows!  We were quite comfortable with our sweaters on, when relaxing in the evening. \n\nWe met Victor on our second evening and enjoyed a pleasant couple of hours conversing comfortably in English over many things.  We would certainly recommend this accommodation, which is very near to the Danube, Fisherman's Bastion, pubs, cafes, restaurants, a supermarket, the M euro and trams. Judith and Victor are excellent hosts and we would be comfortable staying with them again. \n\nVictor was absolutely great with us !! Very welcoming, kind, full of good advices ! He made our stay in Budapest really good. The flat is really well placed in the city, walking distance from the most important place to see.\n\nVictor helped us with touristguides and we could ask him all the time for insidertipps\n\nVery warm and friendly host who helped me out with everything I wanted to know.

They will introduce the best of options for your travel in Budapest based on your schedule. They would also explain the history to you if you are the first time visiting the place. The hostel is perfectly located in the heart of downtown and just a 1 minute walk to the River Danube at which you can have panoramas of the Danube. For food, just downstairs are a lot of restaurants and bars to satisfy your gastronomic needs. All main scenic spots are all in walking distance. The owner would provide daily breakfast for free. If you want to taste Chinese food, they can make for you on request in a very less pay. The sleeping room is very neat and comfortable with quiet environment. Not noisy at all because their home is on top floor facing another side not the street side. I highly recommend this hostel for all Chinese and foreigners who want to have a budget stay in a warm family. \n\nI am back because it is a great place and the hostess and the family are truly wonderful.

You cannot ask for a better neighbourhood than this. everything was so close by and lively. \r\nGod bless you.\n\nThe host was nice, warm-heart, happy to give the information to the visitor. Just when I make the order, I thought was a private room but actually was a bed place. It's a good choice for the traveller want to experience familiar at home in China. The location is good, quite in the central.\n\nThe overall experience of staying in Ms Gao's home is very pleasant. Ms Gao is a very friendly and nice host. She assisted me in everything I needed.

Location is great and very close to a strip of affordable restaurants offering a range of Hungarian foods but also options such as burgers, tapas and pizzas etc. A short walk from one of the main avenues with loads of shops, authentic restaurants and cafes. Every tourist site was within a 25 minute walk or you can catch the hop on hop off bus including boat river tour for a very affordable price. \n\nFavourites to visit were thermal baths, city ice rink, st Stephens basilica and the Christmas markets around the city.\n\nThe apartment was clean, comfortable with everything we needed including a hair dryer. \n\nVioleta and Robert were extremely helpful giving us a map and locating places for us that we should visit; very knowledgable about the city.\n\nVisit circuzcs restaurant for breakfast!\n\nOverall amazing holiday- very authentic, it was like living as a local.\n\n100% would stay again\n\nRoberto and Violeta were very kind and friendly hosts. Roberto welcomed us at the appartment and gave us a lot of information of the city. The appartment is very good located, in the middle of the city. Everything was maximum in 15-20 min walking distance, metro was not needed. Violeta gave us a nice handmaded gift at the end of our stay. We surely recommend this nice and clean appartment to others!\n\nThis apartment was great, very local and near to all the main sights! Robert and Violeta were fantastic at showing us multiple different places to go and what sights are worth visiting. I definitely would recommend staying here and would consider returning myself. The apartment itself was very clean, the beds were comfortable and we were equipped with everything we needed.

The apartment is well located, close to so many good restaurants and bars and a short walk to all of the major sightseeing attractions.\n\nVioleta & Robert are great hosts & were extremely helpful during our stay in Budapest. They were quick to answer any of our questions and gave us some great advice about where to go. They were great allowing us to stay longer than the check out time as we had a later flight. \nThey were both the most thoughtful hosts, giving me a little birthday present. I would recommend their apartment to anybody. It was lovely, clean & well equipped & in a great location. \n\nThe apartment was very clean and inside a quiet courtyard. The kitchen was equipped with everything if you want to save on eating out and there are multiple supermarkets just around the corner. The bathroom was very nice as it was the bed. The interior is quite different from everything we've been to so it was exciting to stay in it. \nIt's a walking distance from most major sights and landmarks. For some of the more distant, the metro is just two blocks away.\n\nRobert was very kind and helpful. He explained and gave us tips for most of our stay.\n\nI highly recommend it and will probably come back :)\n\nWe had the best time in this apartment!\n\nVioleta and Robert are wonderful hosts that really care about your experience being top notch.

It is cozy and intimate, well-equipped and very modern.\n\nBudapest was beautiful and the weather was so nice! We'll come back one day for sure. Thanks for everything!\n\nWe have just returned from our short trip to Budapest which is possibly the most fun and interesting city we have visited to date. The trip was made even better by our stay in this lovely apartment, right in the centre of Budaest in the Jewish district. The flat is surounded by fantastic places to eat, drink (about 10 minutes from the famous Szimpla ruin bar) and loads of street art. You are also about a 15 minute walk to both the baths and the river. The flat itself is perfect for two people, with great facilities and extras (like a coffee machine). Voileta and Robert are possibly the nicest hosts you could ask for and make you feel very welcome from the moment you get there. Thanks for a great trip! :)\n\nVioleta and Robert ' s appartment is really perfect. The situation in Budapest is extraordinary. Moreover it s fully equiped and very clean.\nI also want to thank Robert who welcomed us very late in the flat with the smile!

Communication was outstanding and it couldn't have been easier to check in and out. Highly recommend for a city-break.\n\nThe apartment is very beautifully furnished, very clean and cozy with a large comfortable bed.  It's located in a great place for the castle, 5-10 mins walk to the metro for the other side of the river and a great vegan cafe nearby which we loved. We were unlucky that noisey building works were going on next door for 3 days of our stay but we understand this is out of the control of the owner. The actual apartment is really wonderful. We loved the whistling kettle too! \n\nGreat place, with chic interior. Super location if you want to be on Buda. Very close to everything. \r\nAs this is an old mansion block - from what I assume the last last century - and faces the inner courtyard, it is slightly colder in the apartment than I'd like it to be but easy to control the heating with the thermostat. (Also no radiator in the bedroom area if you close the partition doors)\r\nSuper stay overall.\n\nThe apartment was in the perfect location, tucked away on a quiet side street but walkable to the city and all major tourist locations. Overall it was an enjoyable stay, access to the building was very easy which made our arrival and departure time flexible and Noemi was quick to communicate.  Though there were a couple of negatives - there was construction happening in the apartment next door which was incredibly loud, this started around 8am every morning so we unable to sleep in. The shower also had poor drainage which caused minor flooding in the bathroom. Other than that we had a good time! \n\nPerfect beautifull quite and peacefull\n\nVery nice apartment. Noemi was helpful and easy to contact on the phone.\r\n\r\nReally enjoyed our stay here.\n\nI loved Noemi's place especially the location. I love the sunrises and this apartment is close to the top of the  Buda hills from where you have the best view over Budapest and catching the best sunrises ever. The apartment is cozy, clean, has everything you need for a short gateway. Next is a charming place where you can eat or have a coffee and also a small friendly grocery shop where you can find to buy all needed to eat, drink. The place is also a walking distance to the chain bridge and other touristic venues, I loved my staying her and highly recommended.\n\nThe location was amazing and everything went as smoothly as we could have hoped for! We walked to all of the major historic places in both sides of the city from the apartment, even the City Park, Margaret Island, and the Citadella. \n\nExcellent appartment, good place\n\nReally nice flat, clean and cosy.

It was central to alot of places and was able to walk and get transport. So many delicious food places right around the corner.\nPlace was really clean and everything we needed was there. I enjoyed the stay and would recommend staying here!! Had a blast!\n\nWe couldn't have found a more perfect place for our weekend break it Budapest! This place is AMAZING! It's so close to everything - the sights, right next to the nightlife (but on a quiet side street so very peaceful), great choice of restaurants nearby and the area felt very safe.\nThe apartment itself is wonderful - spotlessly clean and has everything you need. The hosts were wonderful and couldn't have been more helpful - they even let us leave our bags for the day as we had a late flight. \nI couldn't recommend it highly enough and we will definitely be returning! Thank you! :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything was great, the place is in a great location and the hosts are wonderfull.\n\nEyal is a great host with a perfect place to stay in the very center of the beautiful Budapest. There is nothing to complain or to reproach. Fast and friendly responding, nice clean light flat which is close to everything you want to see or visit. Very friendly price. Once I will travel to BUD one more time (and I hope, it will be soon) I hope that he will have free room for me once again. :) \n\nHow about this for service? I write a message to Eyal at 3am, and at 5am he writes back and apologises for the late reply! Thanks so much to you Eyal and to Raz, also for being so understanding when I overslept and checked  out late. Thoroughly looking forward to my return around May.\n\nbed and breakfast.... no breakfast, only bed.\nanyhow, very nice apartament, quiet, and clean.\nI will retourn if possible.\n\n\nThis was the first time using Airbnb and it perfect everything I needed was at Eyal's place and they waited for me to make sure everything was fine and up to my standard and I hope I can stay again, definitely recommend this place, next to everything right in the city! \n\nEyal was very helpful and sweet during all our stay. The house is very cozy, comfortable and clean. Its very central and well communicated. We were very happy with our stay, super recommend!\n\nIt`s a great place to stay. It feels like home, and it was super clean. Meanwhile it is in the middle of the city centre, you have the luxury that the apartment is facing to a backstreet, and it`s dead quiet.Shops and public transport are in walking distance. \n\nThe apartment looked exactly as shown in the pics. It was warm and cosy and the host was friendly and easy to communicate with. It's in a great area with lots of bars and places to eat but it also very quiet and safe. It's easy to get to from the airport on the blue metro line. Would recommend for the price and location.

Evrythink clean and a lot of towels.\r\n\n\nThe view is stunning even though I was there in november. the beds are a bit hard, but other than that the room was just perfect. \n\nThe apartment was really nice and offered a stunning view,  a nespresso machine with a few capsules (you probably have to buy more - can be bought opposite to the Opera at nespresso) It's a roof top aparment so naturally the space is a little special but works fine. for a person with bad knees it's not recommended but then again it might be better Living in the more flat pest side. The host was very helpful and answered quickly. Everything was clean and the beds where comfy. I do recommend this place and don't forget to stop by for a drink at the tiny pub close by. (URL HIDDEN)\n\nVery nice hosts!!!\n\nZsuzsa is a very nice person super attentive that your stay will be a good one. Extremely responsive if you need anything ! The flat and the terasse were just amazing, while not in the city center (so no noise) but next to the castle. I would really recommend this place\n\nGreat views over Pest - the Istvan Church and the Parliament buildings which tower out of the city.  The flat has a wonderful little balcony with nice views. Well equipped kitchen and two bedrooms.  The kitchen is also the sitting room.  There is no couch so we used the balcony chairs inside when it was cool.  Easily reachable with public transit (bus 16 which runs every few minutes and stops 100 metres from the flat.  Easy and pretty walk to the Chain Bridge to cross into Pest. There is a little grocery steps away and a few restaurants although we ate on the Pest side. \n\nZsuzsa was very helpful with suggestions. \n\nI would recommend staying here definitely.  \n\nThis is a terrific flat in the best location and with the most wonderful view. It is beautifully decorated and thoughtfully equipped with everything you need. Can't recommend highly enough.\n\nWe had a fantastic time at Zsuzsa's.

Third time staying at Judit's and counting. Really special place\n\nJudiit's apartment is a happy place in Budapest ! After a busy day in Budapest I would kick back on the comfy couch and enjoy the funky decor of the living room . Great, little terrace as well , if you are coming in the warmer months. The location is so good,  just a bit off the beaten path but very close to everything as well . Does not have a full kitchen, but Judit  will update you on everything  the kitchen does have , including fridge ,coffee maker and utensils. She is an EXCELLENT hostess and always available to your needs. Maybe one drawback would be not the the most comfortable bed according to American standards but perfectly adequate for my two weeks stay . ( the couch also pulls out into a sleeper ) \n\nGreat again. Second stay, will come back\n\nJudit was very nice and welcoming persons, and nice to speak with our.\r\nIt was an absolute pleasure staying in your flat. I am surely come back.\r\nA great location, clean, organised and comfortable, good atmosphere, quiet, all ok. \r\n\n\nWe had a great experience staying in Judit's apartment. \r\nIt's in a great location! Very central and convenient to catch any public transport.\r\nThe apartment has a very tasteful interior, and felt quite comfortable. Even though it only has sofa bed, it was surprisingly pleasant to sleep on.\r\nJudit was a great hostess, gave us lots of useful recommendations and tips for our traveling.\r\nIf you want to try out an insightful local experience in Budapest, we would highly recommending her charming apartment. \r\nYing & Jerry \r\n\n\nI had a two weeks stay at Judit, in a very quiet area and close to the stunning castle view. I really enjoyed the stay and Judit was a great host. \n\nGreat location with very accommodating hosts. The Budapest Castle district is an amazing area for anyone. Romantic, quiet, with direct transportation to the party district (Bus 16 stops on the corner, or you can jump on almost anything from the square 2 minutes away). Public transportation runs all night. Make sure that you try the little confectionery down the street.\n\nOur stay at Judith apartment was very pleasant.  We were welcomed by her son Boldizsar. He assisted us throughout the whole trip and it was very nice to have such a support.  The apartment itself is very well designed and has everything you may need through a 2wk stay.  (if not Judith will kindly help).  Also we enjoyed places that Judith recommended to us. Riso restaurant was really good. One of the things that we enjoyed a lot is the location - really near the Buda castel and still close to metro and easy to travel everywhere.  Mammut shopping center was a big help as well (grocery is there).  We would really recommend everyone to stay at Judith place. It's one of the best.\n\nWe enjoyed our stay in Judit's well decorated and funky apartment.  She and her son were very welcoming!  The location is great - close to the old city core, and a major public transportation station. Very good value.  \n\nI've been living in Budapest and now I do returning to the city as a visitor. I choosed Judit's place because I'm convinced this location is among the best around. It's very relaxed, safe and at the same time is very near of the main 24 hours operating traffic hub of Buda side. Frankly speaking, there are many places under the Castle Hill, but only this certain area (the Vienna Gate neighborhood) combines these two essentials.  The apartment itself is a secret shelter, quiet, convenient and tastefully designed as shown in the pictures. Cool on sommer heat, and there is a possibility for smoking outside on the backyard garden. The pull out sofa provides a surprisingly good quality of sleep and the Castle Walkway is a priceless experience of Budapest city.I would recommend anyone who is planning to stay calm.", "accommodates": "4", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "2PM - 12AM (midnight)", "availability": "The minimum night stay for this listing varies.", "host_reviews": "18", "beds": "4", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/7109253", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": false, "review_summary": "Castle Hill is one of the most beautiful part of the city.

We just finished its refurbishment: it has a separate smaller bedroom and a large living room, plus a dining area, a basic kitchenette for breakfast, a bathroom and a patio.\n\nThe interior is a contemporary mixture of the collectibles of the Hungarian recent past, vintage style, and high-quality design items. It serves as a private Home Gallery as well - with Hungarian artist's original works.\n\nBuda Castle area is a special blend in the city: a green residential area, a lively historical place and a well located urban homestay. The one-way street we settled in is very quiet, the most beautiful walkway and breathtaking panoramic view of the city are just right above us in 3 minutes walking distance.\n \nThe apartment itself located in a Bauhaus building, on the ground floor. That\u2019s why it has a garden connection through the all window wall: it is very pleasant to sit outside, listen to the birds and hedgehogs and have some fresh air especially in the morning with a cup of coffee.\n\nBudapest is not a big city: you can reach the famous cosmopolitan downtown \"ruin pubs\" area in 15 minutes by bus or tram or subway.

I even walked there by foot. :) \r\nAlso the way from the airport to the apartment is very easy and takes about 30-40 minutes.\r\nThe communication with Kitty was perfect, she gives very good hints of what to do in Budapest and replies super fast to messages. \r\nThank you so much for the perfect hospitality! \n\nIt was excellent. Totally excellent.\n\nWonderful flat, quite near to Danube, some lovely coffee places in the neighborhood and a really kind host Kitti. We enjoyed our stay!!\n\nKitti is a great host, even though we never met. She was always quick to respond and supplied us not just with a smooth arrival (very late at night), but also gave good recommendations and e.g. helped us where to find lockers for our suitcases in the south of Budapest (go to Nepliget station). The place is clean, comfy and the location is great to explore the city! Thanks a lot again, Kitti!\n\nKitti is a great host, she was really communicative prior to our arrival and was there to meet us when we arrived. She had even prepared a list of all her and Viktor's favourite places to eat in the city and things to see and do as well- which was really helpful. \n\nThere were 3 of us and we slept comfortably, two on the bed upstairs and one on the sofa bed downstairs. The kitchen was the most well-equipped kitchen I've ever seen in an Airbnb so if you wanted to stay in and make your own meals you could easily do so. \n\nThe apartment is about a 30 minute walk to all the main tourist spots but there are plenty of more local spots on the way and you can take the metro into the centre of town in about 10 minutes. We walked everywhere but a 72hr ticket should you want to catch the metro, tram or bus costs as little as \u00a310 for all 3! \n\nWe would definitely recommend staying here and will certainly be back should we ever come back to Budapest. Thank you Kitti! \n\nGreat place and Kitti is a really nice host. Thank you very much!\n\nMyself and my partner stayed in this lovely apartment for 3 nights! Although I never got the pleasure of meeting Kitti she was only a text message away and was always very quick to respond and always helpful. The apartment is located in a perfect area very central to everything. The apartment was perfect and immaculate upon arrival we couldn't be happier! Kitti left a list of places to visit , of which we visited most and were very pleased. We definitely  recommend Szimpla Kert which is a funky cool pub, the Doblo wine bar is another must if you visit , and also the Vintage Garden (restaurant) they are all located very close to each other. Overall we are extremely happy with our stay here and would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone! \n\nLovely apartment, very nice decor. Easy walking distance to the Parliament building and a huge shopping centre. Despite a little problem with a leak from the upstairs flat, Kitti was fantastic and very communicative. Gave us a discount for the issue and let us stay late to accommodate our later flight. Great value, would stay again\n\nThanks for having us and for all the helpful recommendations and good communication Kitti, the flat was very conveniently located and clean. \n\nBeautiful flat .!!

He did the best for my welcome and quick answers for any doubt or questions I asked him.\r\nThe apartment is very beautiful and perfect located in the heart of the city.\n\nThis flat is in a very busy area in Budapest. If you like to be in the center where things are happening, this is a good choice. Easy to walk to the most parts of the city, good communications by subway, tram and busses.\r\nThe flat itself is big enough for two, with a comfortable bathroom.\r\n\r\nThere are some things to notice though. The location means even a busy night life on the street in front of the house. I woke up late night/early morning several times of loud voices caused by gangs of well-oiled people, in part because of the old windows, that block neither cold or noise very well. That happened both weekend and weekday nights.\r\nThe flat is not too well equipped, you will find a pair of plates with the belonging utensils, but don't hope to find anything in the kitchen cabinets and drawers. You get practically what you see on the pictures, no more.\r\nThe washing machine belongs to a museum, I doubt anyone else than those who are familiar with it would dare to use it. There is only one key to the apartment, so if you have different errands at the same time, you have to arrange a solution so you both can enter the apartment anytime you come home.\r\nI found even the towels and the bed-linens would need an update.\r\nParking is an other challenge, the hard to find parking places are expensive and you have to pay 12 hours per day.\r\n\r\nLevente turned out to be a reliable, responsible person, who was easy to come in contact with when we needed his assistance.\r\n\r\nTo submit my impressions; this apartment can be a good choice for the right person, but some details need definitely an update, to make the place worth it\u2019s price.\n\nLeventes apartment is as described: spacious, clean and with the necessary equipment for everyday life. Nearby you will find a bakery with fresh bread as well as small supermarkets. The apartment is in the center of the citiy, but quiet enough so that you can sleep without being disturbed by constant traffic. Communication was easy. When I had to change my time of arrival Levente was flexible enough to accept the new date. I only can recommend Leventes apartment and thank him for an enjoyable stay.\r\n\n\nThis was my first Airbnb experience and thanks to Levente it was an excellent one! I booked very last minute but there was no hassle. He went out of his way to provide me clear directions and gave great advice on places to go and see, as this was also my first time in Budapest. Couldn't have asked for a friendlier host, Levente made me feel so welcome.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was beautiful and even bigger than it looks in the pictures! In such a good location with shops, restaurants and bars right on your doorstep. \r\n\r\nHave recommended to a friend and would definitely book again if I return to Budapest!\n\nThe house is in an excellent location and very close to acces. Exactly how it looked in the pictures; even bigger! Levente is the best host: always ready to help in everything. A really nice person.Answering very quickly and always dispo to make your stay perfect.  Definitely recommended! And his gift is amazing ;) Thanks a lot Levente.\n\nLevente's apartment is stunning! A beautiful, Parisian Style apartment, right in the heart of Budapest. It is close to Metro stops and easy to walk everywhere. Levente was very accommodating with meeting for the keys.\n\nThe apartment is very lovely and it is exactly how it appears in the photos. Levente was very kind, He provide me a lot of information on the city, the transports and the services and he help me in arrange the travel between the airport and the apartment. The apartment is in a pedestrian area and it is very central, It is the heart of the Hungarian Broadway with a lot of public transports and there are nice places in which have dinner or a drink. There is also a very uselful supermarket in few meters from the house opened from 7 a.m. to 22 p.m. \r\n\r\nI have loved the breakfast provided in the bar in front of the apartment where you may choose between sweet or salted breakfast and you may enjoy it in the internal tables or in the outside ones \r\n\r\nIt is the perfect place in which stay to discover the city and enjoy the night life\n\nGreat place in a great location. Very responsive host. I'd recommend s stay \n\nLevente was a nice and helpful host. The apartment is located in a small street with a lot of bars. You can reach almost everything by foot.

Definitely recommended to anyone!\n\nThe whole process through from booking - staying and checking out was great! We never met Lidl but she was very helpful and really responsive to messages so we were very happy with the stay. I had heard that Budapest was notorious for dodgy Airbnb's but Lidl's place was as described. She has a friend called Magdelena gave us all the information we needed when we arrived. \r\n\r\nI was very grateful as I was unwell so was able to stay an extra couple of hours after check out. Lidl also let us keep our bags in the flat the whole day even after we left the room. \r\n\r\nIt was right near a metro so easy to get around and on a main road so felt safe and was walking distance to many sights as well. I would recommend staying here to others looking in the same price bracket. \n\nThe best option if you are planning to visit Budapest. We met lidi the day that we arrived and she was really nice with us. If we come back to Budapest, we will stay with lidi again for sure!!!\n\nVery central clean tidy apartment. Close to all main attractions. Lidi was very helpful. Beds are approx 100mm foam depends what you like but I could feel the wooden slats underneath so needed two foam pads. Washing machine and deep relaxing bath. \n\nI would definitely recommend staying here. The location was perfect, the room and apartment were spacious and exactly as described. Lidi checked us in and gave us the run through which was very helpful. She also gave us great recommendations that lead to some of the best meals we had in our time in Europe.\n\nThis has been among the best airbnb experiences so far. The house was located in the city center close to the best restaurants in the area and less than 3 min walk to the metro station. The house was very clean and had all the facilities you need (kitcken, dish washer, fridge, hair dryer, A/C...). Would definitely book again.\n\nLidi's apartment is in a great location and very clean with great amenities. Lidi provided great recommendations for food and drinks in the area.\n\nThe house is great,  the location is perfect exactly I'm the main square of Budapest.  Is very clean and comfortable. \nLidi was always available and give us a lot of advices of places restaurants and things to do\n\nThe place to sleep in Budapest ! The host really helped us to discover her city. Good situation next to Metro station and the center. Very clean and quiet.

We cooked and relaxed between our trips.\nIt's a beautiful place with everything you need and even more features than written on airbnb (e.g.:iron, washing machine). It's really close to Mathiass Church and using the 16th bus you can easily get into the Inner City.\n\nAll in all, it's simply GREAT !\n\nWe stayed three nights in Mates appartment and we had a great time in Budapest. We seriously fell in love with this city, its buildings and its people. The appartment is the perfect starting point for exploring the city. If you walk out the door you are almost directly at the beautiful Matthias Church and the Fisherman's Bastion. The Bus 16 stops - in the direction coming from Pest - directly in front of the appartment. Nevertheless the appartment, the house and the surroundings are really calm. The appartment has everything that you need for your stay and for cooking.\nUnfortunately we were not able to meet Mate or his mother, as our flight was delayed, but they left the key at a nearby restaurant.\nI would totally recommend Mates appartment, we will definitly come back.\n\nThe place was nice, quiet and clean. We stayed here as a couple but it is spacious so you can easily stay here with more people. Besides a little misunderstanding at the check in, our stay was great and the place very comfy and centrally located in the castle district. \n\nGreat flat in an excellent location! Enjoyed our stay here. Flat is clean and tidy.\n\nWe spend 4 lovely days in Budapest. M\u00e1t\u00e9 was very receptive and made things easy for us in terms of arrival. Although we couldn't meet him directly as he is living abroad, her friend was very nice and was waiting for us quite late at night when we arrived.\nThe flat is very nice, clean, fully equiped and very well located, just 5 minutes walking from Mathias Church in Buda and 5 minutes from the river. \n\n\nWe really enjoyed our stay in this clean and well situated apartment. The location really was perfect. The communication with Mate and his mother was prompt and very helpful.\r\nI would certainly recommend others to stay here. \n\nMates apartment is in a great location in Budapest and made our stay amazing. The flat is really spacious, with a large sitting area, bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. The location of the flat is also nice, we had dinner one night at the restaurant directly below the flat and and also spent a few hours in the beer garden on the corner of his building(about 30 feet away). The bus stop is a minute away from his flat and the metro is a 10 minute walk. Mate and his mom were very accommodating and quick to communicate with us. I would stay here again for any future trip to Budapest! \n\nThe location of the apartment is great, you're at a 5min walk away from the Batthyany Metro and trem stations and  20 meters away from the Fisherman's Bastion and the Castle District! The apartment is spacious, clean, modern and very comfy. You've got everything you need including a very fast wifi. We only had email communication with the owner, unfortunately it was not possible to meet, but every time we needed to ask, she answered our emails quickly. I absolutely recommend this apartment! \n\nThank you for everything. The Apartment was perfect\n\nGreat host and lovely, modern, clean apartment. Good location and restaurants and shops close by.

I enjoyed this stay very much!! \n\nThe apartment is tidy and convince ,nearby the city center,and Sanyi is nice,we arrived in Budapest airport and choosed Sanyi  to pick us up,it's better than taxi . It's a nice trip in Budapest.\n\nVery nice location in the center of Budapest with a great view. Host was very flexible and kind\n\nThis house just before the chain bridge, and when you open the window ,you can see the parliament right opposite. The beautiful Danue river in front of the house. Tram 19 can take you along the river bank. Good location. Kind host Sanyi waiting for me at the house when I arrived,and have good communication between us. I will recommend my friends stay here next journey. Thank you  Sanyi, thank you Budapest.\n\nSandor was great, he met us at the airport for a better deal than the taxis and all that trouble of finding one, we really appreciated that.\r\nThe apartment was exactly as the pictures apart from the pictures on the wall as he was redecorating and the spaciousness of the main bed/sitting room suited us down to the ground. The bed was very comfortable and big. The views were wonderful of the bridge and part of the Parliament building. Access by walking to the castle area of Buda was another plus. All in all a 5 star for us. Thank you Sandor\r\n", "accommodates": "4", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 2PM", "availability": "1 night minimum stay", "host_reviews": "99", "beds": "4", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/14686020", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": true, "review_summary": "It's a homey flat with the BEST location in the middle of the city. \nOur district is the part of the World Harritage.

Everything was more than okay! \n\nShe is ver rudeness and irresponseble.\n\nMy check-in time is 11:00am. So I wait Check-in in front of her house at 11:00. But she don't coming. And don't send a message. So I send a message to her. That time she say 'Check-in time at 12:00'. I think if she want to exted the limit, she should send a message to me. But she didn't do it. So I just wait 1 hour. When she come, she didn't say 'sorry'. I recommend this house who want to angry.\n\nPerfect spot for discovering the city. We stayed for two nights and enjoyed a lot. A little bit noisy late at night. Fanni was helpful when settling in and showing us a place where to leave our bags the last day. \n\nFanni is a great host who is always on hand should you need to get in contact. I had an issue with the key to the apartment in which Fanni helped via iMessage. \r\nThe location was great despite getting lost on the way to the apartment, but due to Budapests great transport system and the information Fanni gave prior to arrival i soon found the place. \r\nOnly issue I had was having the room next to the kitchen I heard all the other guests having breakfast and talking but then this isn't fanni's fault maybe the other guests should be more courteous. But overall, a great apartment, in a great location with a great host.\n\nAll good. No outside window so was stuffy but this was expected.\r\n\r\nShower filled up with water so could have done with a plunge!\r\n\r\nOtherwise a pleasant stay in this really well located apartment!\n\nLovely location close to most of the sights. Lots of great restaurants and bars close by the apartment. We stayed in the room with no window for 5 nights, would not recommend it for that many nights. Air quality is bad, and the walls are paper thin so every tiny movement in the kitchen you can hear loud and clear in the bedroom. Not for light sleepers. \nWould stay here again, but in another room with a window of course. Remember to bring your own towel, as the towels here are small and look dirty (although they are not).\nFanni was easy to reach and quick to reply whenever we had any questions.\n\nFanni's place is very comfortable and well located. Nice place to stay for some days!\n\nshe is very kind host ! The house is close to the centre of Pest. All it's clean, bathroom,bedroom and kitchen! absolutely recommended:)\n\nThe room is quite small with no windows and can be suffocating for some however that's not Fanni's fault and I guess you get what you pay for as the price of this room is half of the others. Location is great and room was clean.\n\nThe room is spacious and comfortable with the attached bathroom. There is a nearby supermarket and train line which is convenient. Some of the attractions are walk able from this place. Overall it as a pleasant stay.

I'd totally recommend it :)\n\nVery nice location. Close to city center, pubs, restaurants, etc. \n\nGreat apartment in an excellent location. Everything was clean, the communication was excellent and they were flexible regarding our check-out time. I can definitely recommend it!\n\nApartment of Kati and Fisel was the first our traveling experience through Airbnb. We were so lucky to stay at their flat, it exceeded all our expectations! The apartment looked even better than in the pictures because when we saw it personally, we noticed many beautiful interior design details which made an impression of comlete coziness. There was everything we needed for comfort living, the apartment was clean and tidy. \r\nWe experienced the feeling of real home with Kati and Fisel!\r\nThank you! You made our trip! \r\n\r\nLolita and Dmytro\n\nKati and Fisel were most accomodating and welcoming. We arrived very late at night and they had no problem waiting up for us. Even though it was after 1 in the morning, they still took the time to show us around and talk to us about the best ways to get around Budapest. They had even left us a bottle of hungarian liquer to help us celebrate our anniversary. \r\nThe apartment is exactly as described. Lovely and clean and warm. It is in a fantastic location with restaurants and bars only 5 minutes walk away.\r\n\n\nAs mentioned by others, the place looks exactly like the photos.\r\nThe hosts could not be any more accommodating. They met us at 1 a.m for check-in and allowed us to stay until 4 p.m. on check-out day, and consistently kept in contact with us throughout our stay.\r\nThe place was a little humid, but the dehumidifier took care of the problem. Location was great, near many restaurants and bars, and close to several metro stations. Very easy to travel back to the airport. The place was pretty quiet considering there were bars on the other side of the building which you couldn't hear. Not 100% sound-proof, but what place is?  We highly recommend this place.\n\nAfter following Kati's clear and precise directions to this gem of an apartment I was greeted there by Fisel, whom I found very courteous and generous in her knowledge of the area and her advice.\n\nThe area was very well centrally located close to all public transport links, shopping, restaurants , bars and facilities! \n\nThe apartment itself is set in a quite courtyard setting that leads into a busy, vibrant street . Totally ideal for the Budapest experience!\n\nI would recommend this apartment to any future guests as being a friendly, clean , safe, home from home experience.\n\nThank you Kati and Fisel for such a pleasant and memorable stay x\n\nThis apartment was a great choice, fantastic location, clean and near to public transport. The house was a bit wet, but using dehumidifier and opening the windows it disappeared in a short time.\r\n\r\nThanks to Kati and Fisel for the excelent comunication and flexibility\n\nIm picky when I choose apartments, cause I work in renting and hosting for a long time, but freely I can say whit this one you can not make mistake.\r\nFirst of all Fisel, our host who was so nice, and had  patience for our late train and early arrival that actually was early train and latte arrival :) She was so flexible for our check in.\r\nAfter check in she showed a map and give us a lot of useful information.\r\nAll the time she was  just message away for everything we need.\r\nApartment is spotlessly clean, perfectly designed, comfortable for four people, in a perfect location for exploring city.\r\nIt is based in a party area, but in total silence, cause it is orientated to the garden. Moment when you step on the street you are  surrounded with \"ruinpubs\",  bars, restaurants, and the main historical attractions are on a walking distance. Also public transport is just two minutes away.\r\nSo all in all, great host, clean and comfortable apartment in a strategic place for exploring history and night life but on quiet side so you can have good sleep. For us that's a holy trinity of perfect stay in some city.\r\nThanks guys you have made our stay memorable one. From possible five  stars you have ten from us !\n\nEverything was excellent! We are very pleased with apartment and hospitality. We'll be  happy to come here again!

We were able to walk almost everywhere from here but the apartment feels homely and secluded. David is a very approachable host with lots of helpful tips if you ask\n\nDavid and Kata's place was a beautiful, high ceilinged apartment approx 2 minutes walk away from the famous Chain Bridge and just below the Castle district. David met us upon our arrival with a lovely dog, Mischa. David was very thorough at check-in, making sure we were comfortable and well supported with active encouragement to contact him if we had questions. HE had a lot of helpful suggestions and really made our first night easy. I would stay again for sure. \n\nWe enjoyed a lot staying in Kata's Appartement. It is just as described and although the building is quite old, everything is functional and clean. The location is great, there is also a small minimarket right in the roundabout so we could get our shopping done a few meters away from the house. Everything is well maintained and really quiet any time. David was very welcoming and had great recommendations tailored for us.\n\nDavid was an excellent host and apartment had everything we needed. The location was fine, at the Buda side of the river and next to the chainbridge. If you're not afraid of a little walk you can explore the whole city center by foot. The decoration was youthfull and all the supplies were there. The only downfall was that there wasn't a lot of natural light coming in the apartment, there were no windows at the streetside.\n\nThe apartment is truly lovely! Located perfectly on the Buda side next to the Chain Bridge.\nThis is honestly our favorite place to stay in Budapest not only for its beauty, but for its charm, location, and cleanliness. \nDavid was a wonderful host, and went far and beyond to help us celebrate my birthday!\nThank you so much for a perfect and lovely weekend :)\n\nNothing but good things to say. David was friendly, helpful, efficient and always on hand. The flat was lovely and spacious and in an excellent location to explore both Buda and Pest. Highly recommended.\n\nDavid was a perfect host! He was always very responsive and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was very spacious and cosy. He had a great time there! \n\nDavid was truly lovely. Very helpful with recommendations about where to go. The apartment was fantastic. Great location. And beautiful \n\nWe had a wonderful time in Budapest, and the location of this flat is great! Right next to the chain bridge, and easy walking to the sights on the Buda side of the city. The flat was quiet and comfortable, and the internet is very fast for researching local sights. And thank you for the suggestion of the restaurant Klassz. We had a wonderful meal there, and I will try to find it again the next time I visit Budapest. David is very prompt with communications, and helpful with all questions asked.\n\nEverything was cool, David is a very good host.", "accommodates": "6", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "3PM - 10PM", "availability": "The minimum night stay for this listing varies.", "host_reviews": "45", "beds": "3", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/87915727", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": false, "review_summary": "In the epicentre of Budapest, 20 meters from the Chain Bridge our stylish, spacious and comfortable apartment is a great choice for a stay.

The apartment was modern and unique.  Gyorgy was a great host and very helpful.  Definitely recommended!\n\nGyorgy place is wonderful! If very clean, big, nice and modern areas, very good WiFi, location is extremely good, lost of restaurants, shop, tourist attractions, night  life, metro. The place has washer and dryer machine, iron and iron board, great coffee machine. Perfect place in Budapest!!! \n\nOur stay in Gyorgy\u00b4s apartment was great. Everything was as described, best location, would recommend it!!! \n\nGy\u00f6rgy was waiting for us in the apartment as we agreed, showed us the place and was very nice and helpful. Apartment was great and location was perfect, really would recommend it to everyone especially if you are traveling with car as you have posibillity to use garage parking very near to the aparmtement for free, this was big plus. \n\nOne of the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. George and his wife met us on arrival and explained everything including places to eat. Car park is 2 mins walk. The apartment is stunning. Great location. Walking distance to everything. We liked it so much we extended our stay. \n\nFantastic apartment in great location close to everything. George and his wife met us and explained everything including great restaurant recommendation. Apartment had all mod cons and everything you could need - including welcome chocolate. Safe parking spot provided a real bonus. The best AirBnB we have stayed in Europe so far so extended one further night - highly recommended.\n\nEverything was great. George was very accommodating and helpful. It was a little warm and stuffy when we first got there but he brought a fan over for us and it was great after that. The location is very close to the metro and there are lots of great restaurants and bars nearby as well. The ability to park our car in a parking garage about a block away from the apartment was also a huge plus. \n\nGeorge was a fantastic host. He greeted us upon arrival with his family and walked us through his property and provided us all pertinent info, which I appreciated. He also provided ample household supplies (i.e., laundry detergent, US to EU wall converter, etc) which we found to be very helpful as well. He also allowed me to keep the converter as I was unable to locate another in Budapest and was continuing to travel after my stay here. Thanks again for that!\r\n\r\nThe property is in a great location in the old Jewish quarter with a lot of nearby restaurants and bars and access to public transportation via the Deak Ference Ter underground station. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend the property and George to anyone considering the property for their upcoming trip to Budapest.  \n\nMy girlfriend met Gyorgy, she said he was both professional and friendly :)\r\n\r\nThe apartment was exactly as described, we loved the shower and beds. The street is quiet and close to popular Kiraly Street and Andrassy Avenue.  \r\n\r\nHowever at late night foot traffic can be loud on weekends but given the proximity to bars/clubs/restaurants this is to be expected :) It wasn't anything city dwellers would be unused to.  We can certainly recommend the Trofea Grill nearby!\r\n\r\nAn additional benefit is the complimentary guaranteed parking  in a public garage one block from the apartment.\r\n\r\nBasically a fantastic apartment for people looking to explore Budapest nightlife, you won't go wrong here.\n\nGy\u00f6rgy was very welcoming. Even though we have requested late check-in, he was there on time and spent enough time explaining us all details that we needed. \r\nThe listing was very accurate. We came by car and were also using private parking. \r\nLocation was perfect. It was close to everything, but also not noise in the evening.

She had a map at the apartment and recommended some nearby streets for restaurants. As well, she had very kindly stocked the apartment with some fruits, drinks and snacks which made staying very easy and homey. Finally, she and her family live nearby and she offered to be available in case anything came up, which was great. Checking out was quick and painless.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is extremely convenient to the centre of the city and to transit for anything further away while the building itself is an atmospheric old building right next to the basilica.

It's a really great place to couple or single tourist! Near with popular tourist attractions. Clean and wonderful place!!\n\nVery nice location of the apartments, very close to the Old Town. All the best tourist attractions of Buda are very close to this place. Apartments has everything you need - fridge, microwave, coffee machine. There is always a hot water in shower, house has calm and quiet private yard, so it's really quiet  in the evening and sleeping hours.\r\nSmall store is nearby, and big Spar supermarket is close to the subway station. My mom didn't see Adam in person, but his instructions in message and email were very detail and friendly. I can totally recommend this place from my mother's words about this accommodation.

It's within waking distance. The place was very clean and tidy when I arrived. My only complaint is the bed. Although the bedsheets seemed clean, after my first night I woke up with flea bites. I was very annoyed. If the mattress and duvet are changed are changed, I would definitely recommend the place.  \n\nThis was an interesting little flat. The description and pictures in the listing were accurate and \u00c1d\u00e1m was a great airbnb host. \n\nAdam is a good Host, he was really friendly. The location of apartment was great and the flat is so kind of sweet.\n\nAdams\u2019s appartment is in the very center of budapest, really in the middle of main attractions, but also a quiet place. It was great to book on the same day I arrived. Adam confirmed quickly and came personally to welcome me. I had a great stay, thanks!\r\n\n\n\u00c1d\u00e1m is a great host, very accommodating. Let us leave our bags at the accommodation for a few hours after our stay. The place was perfect for us. Well equipped kitchen and free coffee. If you're wanting to stay in Buda this is a great location, close to the Castle, Danube and some of the baths, however as we spent most of our time in Pest there was a fair bit of walking for us. The place was clean and tidy, would definitely recommend staying here.\n\nThe flat is really convenient because of it geographic situation. The flat has everything, sweet details from the host. \nHowever, there are only 2 little windows and no view\n\nAdam was amazingly nice. We arrived a few hours late for check in but he was nice enough to meet us at the place.\nThe location is TOTALLY AMAZING, near to an arabic restaurant (which we found really convenient) and close to the bus stop. Close as in around 3-4 minutes, it is that close. The place is also really close to the castle.\nWe loved out stay and really recommend his place.", "accommodates": "2", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 1PM", "availability": "1 night minimum stay", "host_reviews": "129", "beds": "1", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/7732643", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": true, "review_summary": "Small studio flat for a low price.

It offered us easy access to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps and Internet to help with translation and attractions near by. The apartment was clean, and very modern- just upstairs to some really good quality restaurants and places to get breakfast. On the second to last day there was a problem with the buildings water and our taps and showers were off for an hour- at the time we were desperate for showers but our host was amazing and offered us there nearby apartment while this problem had arose. \n Overall the trip was complete with this cute little apartment that we could go back to at the end of a long day. Definitely recommend, and will return to next time in Budapest \n\nGreat service, I would totally recommend it! Loved the area and the apartment, very cozy and clean! \n\nThe hosts assisted me in airport connections, meetup for entry to the apartment, and everything else.  The apartment was comfortable and clean, bright and cheerful, great kitchen, super convenient and beautiful location.  Would definitely go back!\n\nAbsolutely lovely apartment, in a great location. The hosts impressed from the moment we booked, and where very friendly and helpful. If we came back to Budapest we would definitely stay here again! \n\nIt was great to be welcomed so warmly. And to feel that we could reach out if we needed anything.

Gave me a detailed tour of the listing and provided the information i needed for a good trip. I thought their provision of a cell phone was a great and thoughtful addition to the trip for people who otherwise would not have the ability to communicate. I had to leave early, and they were very understanding. Good place to stay for the price, and if you like nightlife, the location would be perfect for you. \n\nThe rental is exactly as in the pictures, great light and the washer and other amenities really came in handy. Consider a visit to 360 bar just around the corner if you want a stunning view of the city at sunset (or anytime!). In general, the location was outstanding, very central, metro-accessible, and walking distance to lots of excellent food and shopping opportunities. We would definitely consider staying here again on our next visit to beautiful Budapest!\n\nAllan and crew run a tight ship.  The apartment was clean and exactly as pictured.  Allan's team organized an airport pickup and also set up a dinner cruise for us.  The location of the apartment was great for exploring Pest.  We loved the ruin bars and so many were in walking distance.  The only slight drawback was the noise from other tenants/guests in the building.  Some of the tenants or guests were obscenely load at very late hours.  Singing at the tops of their lungs.

Definitely recommend it.\n\nDefinitely the best airbnb experience!!!\nEverything is good.\nWe recommend you this apartament.\nNice and clean place and complete with everything you needed.\n\n\nEverything was great. Thank you!\n\nLovely bright, sunny flat in a great location. Peaceful and quiet. Exactly as shown in the photos. Public transit right outside the door. Communication with Reka was great. She met me at the flat on my arrival, and again when I left. When I had a question, she'd call me within minutes. I highly recommend Reka's apartment -I would certainly stay here again!\n\nThe host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n\nR\u00e9ka is a great host ; very kind and always ready to help and in a very timely manner. The flat is even cosier than what one can think when seeing the photos! Perfect for a short stay or even for a longer rent with a very convenient location.\n\nGreat and friendly host. Excellent apartment. I would definitely recommend staying here.\n\nReka's flat has been my home for the past 2.5 months. The space is ideal for one person and when my girlfriend came over for a couple of weeks it has been good as well. Everything I needed was there and the bed is comfortable and large, the place is well insulated and there are new radiators. Obviously during the winter days are short but in daylight hours the apartment is in a great position to let light in through its three windows, especially on sunny days and I can only imagine how it is like during the summer months. The location is also great: whilst not in the centre of the tourist area it is nevertheless very convenient for most places of interest. Public transport is very good, trams 4 and 6 are a few minutes walk away and trams 17 and 19 have just started running again after some works, they stop in front of the building, and there are other options too. The local area is also nice with its hills and there is a wide choice of cafes, there are a couple of thermal baths very close by, Lucaks being next door. Margaret Island is a short walk and across the river there is another interesting area with more cafes and restaurants and the Jazz Club. Batthiany and the palace are also easy to reach. I could continue but I will stop here, I will only add that Reka is lovely and has always been there to make sure everything went well. Thank you Reka, I will definitely miss the flat and Budapest!\n\nThe apartment is great, clean, well equipped and very comfortable bed, and with a lot of light. The location is very convenient, close to Margaret bridge and island. Reka is an excellent host, we had an excellent communication and she was very friendly and helpful from the very beginning and all the way long. I will definitely come back!\n\nWe loved staying at Reka's apartment. The location was wonderful, and she was a lovely and accommodating host. The flat was clean and everything the listing promised. I would love to stay there again if I am lucky enough to visit Budapest in the future, it is such a beautiful city. I only wish we had stayed longer, as there is so much to do and 5 days was not enough!

We walked everywhere. \n\nThe place is clean, nice, well arranged and big enough for 4 people but only if your intention is not to spend all the time at home. \r\nIt is also pretty quiet and very well situated in Budapest. \r\nI think that due to lots of booking requests Itamar was not able to answer right away to all my questions, but he gave us information about parking and price ranges. Also we were not able to check in immediately at 4 pm because the guests before us left later than expected which delayed the cleaning. However we were able to leave our suitcases in the apartment so it was not a big problem. \r\nIn overall, very happy with the stay and I would definitely recommend booking this apartment.\n\nWe had a terrific stay at this accommodation. The location was central to all major attractions and food. The host was polite and gave valuable advice. A great value!\n\nThe host was very flexible with check-in which was appreciated. The apartment is great for a couple people with everything you need. The wifi was fast, bd was comfortable and the shower was good. Definitely a good choice for a stay in Budapest. \n\nMy stay at the blue design apartment was very nice. The apartment is located in the center of Budapast which makes it the ideal spot to discover the city. The room itself is small but cosy and has everything you need for a short stay in the city. Definitely would stay here again.\n\nThe place was great. Very nice and in a great location. We enjoyed our stay. \n\nGood location, close to the chain bridge and the tram that goes along the waterline. Very nice apartment, clean and modern; a bit humid but with the humidity machine on for a few hours it was much better. We had a very nice stay in the apartment and Budapest over all! We will definitely go back! \n\nVery good location, we've gone every where by foot. Itamar's friend gave us the keys when we arrive at the city. We would recommend this place and stay there if we return to Budapest for sure. \n\nNice apartment in a good neighborhood. You can find anything you need nearby, everything is walking distance. The place looks just like the pictures, really cosy. One small negative; we were four, but there were not enough bed linnen (blankets and pillows). For the rest, everything was perfect!\n\nThe place was great. The outside of the building is deceptive, but the room is very clean and modern. It is located within walking distance of almost all attractions.\n\nWe were greeted by an American which was nice, and we were shown a couple of hotspots.

They were very welcoming and offered their help in whatever was needed, even arranged for a taxi on the day of our departure. Also they were giving great recommendations where to find what in the immediate neighbourhood and put a bottle of wine in the fridge. What a nice treat! \r\nWhen I asked for a warmer blanket after the first night, they were immediately coming over with another, warmer one, that was just perfect. \r\nThe apartment is best for a couple but there would be space for children or friends on a sofa bed.\r\nIt has a wonderful shower and with all those thermal baths easily reachable by foot or public transportation I didn't miss a bathtub in the end. \r\nThe location was perfect for us and for what we wanted from Budapest. Directly at the steps to Budapest castle, chain bridge within 5 min walking distance. Direct bus to Opera (5-10min), by walking 20-30 min. Many other bus lines next to the house that bring you to Gellert, train station, or other sights. \r\nIn the end we did most by foot as all parts of town with their different sights were easily reachable. \r\nOverall a great stay with lovely hosts that did their best in assisting with whatever was needed if asked. I can definitely recommend the place to others and would also come back anytime.  \n\nThe location is ideal for walking around and seeing all the sights that Budapest has to offer!

Location excellent.\n\nFantastic experience at this place! Beautiful and stylish flat, very clean and well located. Thomas and Katherine were very helpful and easy with everything. Fully recommended!\n\nI travel to Budapest quite regualry and have stayed in several appartments all over the city. This appartment is certainly the most stylish and grand I have stayed in so far. \r\n\r\nThe location is very good - close to the chain bridge in Buda - which is a lovely part of the city and walkable to the centre.\r\n\r\nThe appartment itself has been done out to a very high standard - the style is minimalist - but with everything you need for an ideal stay. Netflix on tap is a nice touch as was the edible treats to welcome guests. \r\n\r\nThe hosts, Katarina and Thomas were lovely, helpful and answered our questions instantly.\r\n\r\nThis appartment is at the higher price range of places in Budapest, but you are getting a really nice location and a very nice flat. I would recommend it for couples wanting to treat themselves.\n\nKatarina communicated very quickly and answered all the questions. They were very welcoming.

I stayed with my boyfriend and we had more than enough room to really settle in and relax and have a great home base for our long weekend in the city.  Anna has made a lovely, warm apartment for her guests and goes above and beyond to make you feel right at home for your stay. I would highly recommend, best airbnb I've stayed after months of European travel. \n\nAwesome flat with some quirky little surprises including an arty advent calendar to open up on days stayed. It was super homely too and was a great base to walk everywhere! Had some fun on the bikes on Margaret island too. Anna gave loads of tips of places to go, visit, eat etc which we used and loved them all. We fell in love with Budapest and the flat certainly contributed to that. Thanks Anna we will be back! \n\nAnna's place was great for a short term stay and is the kind of place perfect for a longer stay as well. The kitchen isn't done justice when described as 'fully equipped' - this thing is ready for a chef! We had a great stay and it's very well located - if you pack walking shoes you wont need to take any transport. The young neighbours seemed like fun too.\n\nAnna's beautiful apartment was in an excellent location, spotlessly clean, spacious, warm, comfortable and cosy, and we loved spending time there. Budapest is also amazing, we loved exploring and could walk everywhere from the apartment. Anna was friendly and very welcoming and we certainly hope to be able to stay at her apartment another time. Thanks Anna :)\n\nThis was our second visit to Anna's gorgeous apartment, and we loved it even more the second time around. There is something so lovely about walking in the door to a place you've stayed and enjoyed before, and the wifi just connects, it feels like a home away from home. Anna is an amazing host too, so so lovely. Thanks again Anna! \n\nThis is a very chic apartment, I loved its design and decoration. Very functional and clean, too. Anna is a wonderful person, very reachable and sweet. The apartment is on the centre of Budapest, steps away from the nearest metro station. Very easy to find, when you are coming from airport. You can walk almost anywhere. On the corner, you will find a market, a cute coffee shop and about 4-10 minutes away there are lots of breakfast/lunch/dinner restaurants, cafes etc. Anna makes sure you have all the information you need. And needless to say, there are two bikes ready for you. It was one of the best, maybe the best AIRBNB experience I've ever had. Thank you, Anna.\n\nFantastic clean and bright apartment in a great area within walking distance of everywhere you need to go. \n\nRecommendations re where to go and eat were perfect. Thank you \nSt Andrea, at the end of the road, is a MUST\n\nAnna's place is perfect. Its a little bit outside of the main tourist area with plenty of restaurants and bars. It's within walking distance to everything you would want to see in Budapest. It's spacious with a cool edgy design and has a separate room with balcony that is perfect  for a couple.  The bed was super comfy, and the kitchen had everything you need. Nothing to fault! Anna was lovely and the perfect helpful host. Thank you!! \n\nI absolutely loved Anna's flat. It is decorated so nicely, and the details you notice once inside, are even better than the photos. Anna was able to meet me a little early to let me drop my luggage ad show me around. Her description of everything was so detailed, and she even made sure there was laundry powder, as I did need to wash some clothes.

The place was very comfortable and spacious for us. The only problem we had was that the internet didnt work while we were there. \n\nGood place, Very comfortable and spatious. Andr\u00e9a is Friendly and open mind. Better to get to the place with a Taxy.\n\nAndrea is a sweet and welcoming lady! She ensured that I was safe and comfortable and waited for me to pick me up from the metro station even when my train was late. She explained everything about the beautiful and quiet house and left me to enjoy it afterward. She was helpful in pointing out tips about transportation and how to get to the airport. Thank you Andrea! \n\nAmazing place! But even more amazing was Andrea. She was so helpful and so nice. Thank you Andrea, we really appreciated the ride from the station and the recommendations that were sent to us. The place had everything that we needed and we were very happy. \n\nBeautiful apartment hid away near an industrial estate. Andrea gave us lots of information about getting round in Budapest. Really helpful. The neighbours were also really friendly and helped us start our car after the battery died.\n\nA accommodation was just right like an offer, only it\u00b4s difficult to find for me. The flat is very nice, clean and with Andrea is very good communication.\n\nMe and my boyfriend stayed 20 days in the apartment's Andrea. She is an amazing person and from day one was keen to help us in whatever it took. The apartment is very large and full, moreover, it is in an area with plenty of space and have to barbecue in the backyard.\r\nI recommend this apartment for those who have a car or are staying more days in Budapest, it is a bit far to go to the center and if you have a few days to explore the city, you'll probably lose a lot of time with the offset. As we stayed 20 days was perfect and we highly recommend. Thanks for everything, Andrea.\n\nAndrea est une personne tr\u00e8s sympathique, qui s'est rendu disponible au maximum pour nous.

But all of them (could choose between two of them) are very stylish, clean and centrally located. Most sights are in walking distance.. I would/will definitely stay again at Anna's apartment(s). \n\nThe lovely apartment did not disappoint me, my husband and I stayed for three nights and we did appreciate the modern decoration as well as the great location of it. The old-style building and elevator were also awesome. Although we did not meet Katalin, her collguage Dorina was very nice to call the taxi picking us up from the airport to the apartment when we were arriving, which made us be fond of the city from the first sight.\n\nThe apartment was a perfect place to stay whilst we were in Budapest, it was so conveniently located that you could walk to all of the main tourist places, and it is within easy reach of some great cafes and restaurants. The apartment itself was lovely, it looks exactly as the pictures show and is very spacious for two people. Would definitely stay here again if I was to come back to Budapest! \n\nIts was great! good location and beautiful apartment.\n\nKatalins apartment was totally perfect for me and my boyfriend. Clean, modern and very very central. Her colleague also arranged airport transfers for us which was very uesful. Katalin herself is also very welcoming. Would reccomend.\n\nOur stay in Katalin's home was absolutely amazing!\nIt is beautiful, tidy, much larger than the pictures and so perfectly located.\nThe staff in charge of running the accommodation were lovely and helpful and gave us so many great recommendations, and were only a text away throughout the stay.\nI couldn't recommend her place more if you want to stay somewhere beautiful and totally, totally central. \nThank you Katalin!\n\nThe apartment from katalin is one of the best Airbnb's I ever stayed in. True value for money. The apartment is clean, well equipped and the location is superb! We bought tickets for the hop on and hop off bus but you don't really need it as all the sites are in walking distance or just a few metro stops away.\r\n Katalin is very quick to respond  and I will definitely recommend this airbnb to my friends. I will book again when I return to this amazing city\n\nGreat location within walking distance of most major sites and convenient to the metro. Old Jewish Quarter was great for bars/restaurants. Would stay again.\n\nThe house itself was wonderful; very clean, beautifully decorated, and brightly lit. It couldn't have been in a more perfect location, literally right next to the basilica and some great restaurants. Katalin was very accommodating and helpful!!

It was very clean and well appointed. Might not be ideal for light sleepers as the mezzanine bedroom is adjacent to the building's main door, which makes a long, loud squeaking noise when closing (might just need oiling). More generally, could be worth booking an airport transfer, as our taxi driver was a really dangerous driver!\n\nA little gem in a beautiful city. Within walking distance to many places in the city. We walked everywhere and didn't need a taxi once! \n\nWonderful little apartment, perfect for any trip\n\nGreat apartment! Bigger than the pictures and had everything we needed. Location was ideal with short walks everywhere and especially to the ruin bars. \n\nAirport transfer both ways was ideal and communication was great.\n\nThank you \n\nFantastic apartment right in the heart of everything! Walking distance to good bars, restaurants and much more. Hosts were very helpful and were easy to communicate with. They supported us in setting up a taxi transfer to and from the airport. Can not fault any part of our experience and would go back in a heartbeat!\n\nNice and clean. Easy to contact hosts. Great location!\n\nGreat apartment. Amazing decor, clean and really good location. \n\nRoof of the loft bedroom is very low. Missing some kitchen items for cooking such as tea towels and utensils.  Also shared laundry facilities with another apartment which isn't ideal in an AirBnB from our perspective but other than that we had a great time.\n\nAndras and Andi are great hosts who go out of their way to ensure your visit is perfect. The flat is as shown in the pictures and in a fantastic location. \n\nThe street, where the flat is located, is surrounded by great restaurants, pubs, ruin bars and easy to get to famous landmarks. The map on the wall gives an indicator of how to get to everywhere you need to go. You can avoid being in the street with a map and having neon signs above you saying 'tourist'. \n\nI would recommend gaining a basic grasp of Hungarian to speak to locals. It goes a long way to making you stand out from rude tourists singing football style chants and being intoxicated on cheap local beer. \n\nA fantastic stay. Would highly recommend.\n\nAmazing Apartment \nIf I returned back it will be my choice again \n\nI highly recommend everything.  Andras and Andi\u2019s flat is exactly as presented on Airbnb.  Besides the usual things one wants in a property, such as cleanliness and a great location, this apartment has a great amount of style as well as comfort and practicality.  Everything from the large, well-appointed bathroom, to the fun and helpful mural map on the kitchen wall shows the amount of care and attention to detail that was taken.  You can tell the construction of this apartment was a labor of love.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood has a great vibe with lots of cool things to see and do nearby.

We spent there only one night, but I hope that we will come again soon and rent the same apartment!\n\nStaying in this apartment was possibly the highlight of our trip! It was ideal was for us, because we wanted something different to the typical basic room, and we're really glad we chose this cool apartment with lots of quirky details. For three people there was plenty of room, with a double bed and a double sofa bed which was equipped with lots of extra blankets/pillows. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood (the Jewish Quarter) was perfect for us. We walked everywhere (except the Szechneyi baths) and discovered some of the city's best ruin bars such as Fogashaz, Mazel Tov, Szimpla Kert and Ellato Kert just around the corner. Definitely the area to be if you're in Budapest for the cool street art/bars/coffee shops/clubs.\r\n\r\nVeronika was a great host and was really flexible with arrival and departure times, which really benefited us considering both of our flights were late at night. She was quick to reply and made our trip as stress-free as possible, even booking airport transfers. \r\n\r\nThanks Veronika, we hope to visit again!\n\nGreat host. The place was exactly as advertised if not better. Truly in the heart of Budapest with all the ruined pubs in short distance. Highly recommended. \n\nVeronika is a great host, very polite and helpfull, gave us instructions and tips for getting around the city and even let us stayed longer than usual time, which was very nice of her. We had a great time and we loved her place. It's in the great neighbourhood, so close to the city center, restaurants and bars (everything within walking distance), and yet just enough away not to be surrounded with heavy traffic, and those street sellers and thiefs, so one can feel safe and as at home. The place is exact as it looks at the photos, very warm and easy to find. We would definitelly recommend it to everyone!\n\nVeronika was extremely welcoming and flexible with our check in time! Showed us all we needed to know about the place and made us feel right at home. The location was also perfect. \n\nVeronika is just lovely, very responsive and caring. Her place which she has called home for years really has a special touch. Funky lighting and high quality finishings and furniture make for a pleasant and entertaining stay. Location was great for exploring Pest and there's a great Thai Soup restaurant on Kiraly that is great value and delicious. Bambus is a great spot and I stayed 2 extra nights I liked it so much!\n\nGreat appartment , photos are trustworthy, very well located . Veronika welcomed us very nicely and politely. Highly recommended, when I return to Budapest I expect to stay here again .\n\nThe apartment was perfect for our short trip for 4 of us. We had everything we needed from wifi to kitchen appliances to a washing machine. It's very central and so everything was at our finger tips. The owner, Veronika, was also very helpful and kept in touch in case we needed anything.

It is cosy and cery clean. Unfortunately we did not manage to meet Viki, maybe next time :-)\n\nViki's flat is located in the best location possible. It is very convenient to all the sights. Did not even have to take public transportation. The flat itself was very clean and cozy. Loved coming home to it after a long day. Never got a chance to meet Viki, but she was always quick to reply whenever I had questions in regards to tips/suggestions. Don't hesitate to book her place! You will not be disappointed. \n\nThe best AirBnB experience I've had so far...\r\n\r\nThis apartment is just so great, in an amazing location, beautifully decorated, and with a great host.\r\n\r\nThe location is in the center of BUdapest just a few minutes away from St. Stephens Basilica, with a lot of great restaurants and bars in the area. It is also within walking distance of most of Budapest's main attractions, as well as being close to several metro stations. Despite being very central, since the apartment is located in a courtyard building, its very quiet inside.\r\n\r\nThe decor is exactly as pictured, and it was very clean when we arrived. The heating system is great, the bathroom is very modern, and there is a washer-dryer if you need to do laundry.\r\n\r\nThe host was also great, allowing us to check in slightly earlier than our original check in time. She was great in letting us know things to do in the city, arranging for an extra cleaning (as we stayed for a long time), and also promptly let us know when there was a problem with the water supply (a burst mains pipe, not the hosts problem in any way, but it effected the whole neighborhood so she let us know about it).\r\n\r\nI highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Budapest... its well worth it!\n\nViki is nice and helpful , I enjoyed my trip while staying in her place . Very clean and in great location . Highly recommend ! \n\nPerfect location and everything else... will return and recommend to others.\n\nFantastic stay, Apartment was exactly as listed and pictured, was a perfect location to explore Budapest. Myself and my boyfriend went for our 1yr anniversary, and literally had everything on our doorstep, restaurants, bars, shops, coffee shops, beautiful Basilica building 50metres up the road, couldn't of asked for more, majority of the top 10 places to visit in Budapest were within walking distance. Viki stayed in touch everyday to make sure we were enjoying our time, recommended some gorgeous restaurants and places to visit, asked if we needed anything and if we were comfortable. Had an amazing time and will definitely come back in the near future. Thankyou so much Viki for all of your help, our time in Budapest was made so much better with your kindness and guidance. \n\nLocation is excellent.  Apartment is modern and clean.  Would have been nice to have had some personal recommendations from Viki on what to see and do and where to eat but we too never met her.  Also, we could have used more towels.  There was only one towel per person for our stay of four days but the apartment itself and location are perfect.\n\nGreat location. Beautiful apartment, as nice as it is shown in the pictures. Safe area. Quiet building. Wifi works perfect. Very clean. Viki is a great host, replying very quick at any enquiry. When I come back I will definitely check if availability! Thks for everything Viki! K\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m! \n\nThe location is really convenient and u can walk or take a bus to anywhere in 20-30mins. The flat is clean and just like the picture u see. Very safe and quite.Vick is a nice host .She is really warm and nice person as well.If my friends will go to Budapest I will recommend they to live here. It was a wonderful experience. \u9019\u88e1\u7684\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u975e\u5e38\u597d,\u53bb\u54ea\u88e1\u90fd\u5f88\u65b9\u4fbf,\u800c\u4e14\u623f\u9593\u975e\u5e38\u6574\u6f54\u4e7e\u6de8\u3002Viki\u4eba\u5f88\u597d,\u6709\u4ec0\u9ebc\u554f\u984c\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u554f\u5979,\u5982\u679c\u6709\u670b\u53cb\u8981\u53bb\u5e03\u9054\u4f69\u65af,\u9084\u662f\u6703\u5efa\u8b70\u4ed6\u5011\u4f4f\u5728\u9019\u88e1!\n\nWe did not get a chance to meet Viki in person but she was very kind to drop me all the instructions for a smooth check in. She was also very helpful to send us some recommendations for food, tours, etc. \r\n\r\nThe location is great. It is a short walk to the metro and the famous rose gelato is just right on the street beside. \r\n\r\nThe only small problem we have is with the door. It is hard to lock and open sometimes.

The flat is small  but very cosy, perfect for 2 people, we stayed 3 nights and was just perfect. The location is great, just 5 minutes walk from the main basilica and next door a 24hrs shop which is great. everything was clean and very well organized, many thanks! :)\n\nThe flat was great and very clean! It was very close to everything and Orsolya was great. She met us at the flat and was very helpful with information about the city.\n\nI had a very nice time at Orsi's flat! Orsi was very communicative before arrival and during my stay. Checking in and out was very easy. \r\n\r\nOverall, the flat is newly renovated, very clean, tastefully decorated. The fan in the flat helps keep the temperature cool enough during the warm days and nights. Automatic lights turn on and off during the night outside the flat, which can disturb sleep, but it wasn't a big issue. \r\n\r\nThe flat is very close to the city center and public transportation. I would recommend staying here! \r\n\n\nOrsolya was extremely friendly, welcoming and helpful! She was there to greet us at the flat, and left us a lovely bottle of Ros\u00e9. We were also given advice on where to go to eat and look around. We had a slight problem with the wifi but Orsolya was very quick to help us out with it and she came straight away to fix the problem. \n\nOrsolya was a great host, very welcoming and gave us great information on the city and things to do! The flat was very clean and modern and in a perfect location in the centre of Budapest. Would definitely recommend to others and visit again!\n\nOrsolya is a really nice hoster! She explained all details about the flat and tried her best to make our stay comfortable. The apartment is new but not big. Ideal for 1-2 persons. Very clean! It has everything you need to stay for 4-6 days. Kitchen is well-equiped, coffee-mashine, dishes, iron, hair dryer, strong shower, ventilator. Wi-fi works also good. Although during the nights it was extremly hot. It is possible to open the windows but then you can hear neighboor's dog and talks. Also automatic lights outside the apartment reacts all the time so it was difficult to fall asleep. But if the weather is not so hot as it was during our stay - it must be quite comfortable to sleep. The apartment is quite close to the railway station and you can reach all main attractions by foot. In general, it is safe. I recomend it! \n\nWe really enjoyed staying in Orsolya's apartment. It is located in our favourite location to stay in Budapest - in downtown Pest, close to bars, restaurants and theatres, close to the main railway station, to the Metro and to trams.

Everything was within walking distance, 5-10 minutes ( markets, chain bridge, parliament, the castle etc). The place itself was very clean and welcoming. The host was very friendly and left us alone.I would definitely recommend this place to anybody wanting to explore Budapest \n\nPeter Peter's apartment was a nice and warm place to stay for 3 days in november in Budapest. We were 4 persons. Peter directions for finding the apartment, getting the key, enter the building were very precise. We didn't even met him. Everything was ok except for the shower, it's a little bit \"old\". \nThank you Peter for Peter Peter's apartment.\n\nAll questions which I asked in advance were answered speedily and accurately. We had all the information we required to find the apartment and settle in. The Airport Shuttle is a great service -  thanks for recommending it.\r\nThe apartment is as all the reviews led us to believe it would be. Simple but spacious and comfortable. We felt we were staying in the sort of home ordinary people in Budapest occupied - and I mean that in a good way.\r\nThe area is superb. Every evening we found somewhere interesting to eat within a few minutes walk.  Buda felt peaceful in comparison to the more frantic Pest but no less interesting. As two women, we felt safe day and night, inside and outside the apartment.\r\nWe had one minor problem with the water,  due more to our lack of familiarity with the system than an equipment fault. Peter and Attila guided us through this promptly and effectively.\n\nPeter's apartment was perfect, exactly as described. Clean, bright, spacious with a lovely living room. The kitchen could have been better equipped, but for ordinary, everyday use was ok.\r\nIn terms of location was great, so close to  Fisherman\u2019s Bastion and Buda Castle. The best part was an absolutely stunning view of the Parlament, Danube River, and bridges, just two minutes walk from the flat.\r\nThe only minus point was weird, bothering smell of gas in the lobby.\r\n\n\nApartment spacious and climate . Clean and neat . Well equipped kitchen. Attractive location. I would recommend for a weekend.\n\nPeters apartment was lovely and clean and in a great location. There were a few minor things that could have been better, like only one bed was made up on arrival (however peters mum did drop off another sheet), the place is noisy from the street and the curtains in the second bedroom are thin so all the light comes in. Apart from that all was lovely and clean and Attila was very communicative. \n\n\nOverall we liked it and felt it was good value for money, however, the washing machine didn't work and the shower was very old and not very good. It would have been much better if these were working properly. \nMore concerning though, was the smell of gas every time we turned the hot tap on! \nWe were impressed with the speed of communication though, all our questions were answered which helped us to enjoy our short stay in Budapest. The apartment was located perfectly, we walked 25 miles in 3 days, and only got on a tram and train once! Loads on your doorstep, a truly beautiful location! :)\n\n\nThe location was perfect! So close to the water and a great view of parliament. Having a whole apartment for such a cheap price was a real luxury. \n\nGreat neighbourhood in Buda close to all major sight seeing. Five minutes walk to the M2 subway station. The apartment was clean and spacious with two hard working fans to keep the space cool. I would recommend and return.\n\nStaying at Peter's place was very nice. The location of the apartment is exactly under the Buda Castle as suggested by its name. Very close to the city center and other touristic points. Also, it was very easy to find , due to the precise information I have received from Attila (Peter's assistant).

Any questions you have about Budapest, dining, shopping, or just being a tourist are more than adequately answered by the front desk staff. My friend and I stayed here and they were most accommodating in holding our bags for us until check-in time and after check-out in order to allow us to not lose any time exploring the city. The communication was excellent prior to arrival and throughout the trip. The location is excellent, about a 5 min walk to St. Stephan's, 5 min to the Opera house and metro, and probably 10-15 to the Parliament building.  Excellent options for food in the area just be willing to explore a little bit. I would definitely stay here again, I wish we had had more time to stay here this time around. Excellent property.\n\nI really enjoyed my stay. The location is ideal\nfor walking around the city and visiting the local attractions. Recommend staying. \n\nI booked this accomodation for my parents to celebrate my\nDad's 60th. The lady they met (unfortunately they cannot remember her name) was friendly and helpful.

The biggest benefits from my perspective are: Excellent location - central, close the Pest city attractions, public transport and yet very quiet, comfortable bed, fast wi-fi and brand new interior. The apartment is suitable for travelers who expect quiet nights.\nThe only downside is that it is located on the 3rd floor with no elevator (100 steps), so it is not suitable for guests with some disabilities.\nI fully recommend Gizella as a host and this apartment for solo travelers or pairs.

If you step out one of the entrances, then just with a few minutes walk you are standing in the Danube shore with a beautiful view of the Hungarian Parliament, or if you step out from the other entrance, you can walk in the streets which are the part of the UNESCO World Heritage. The Matthias church is very close to the apartment, you can even see a little part of it from the house. Walking through the castle\u2019s stairs going by only 750 m you can reach it. Lots of restaurants and caf\u00e9s near to the apartment. Metro and tram, over and above a market hall with a big supermarket just only 100 m form the apartment. But from there you can travel straight to the beautiful Szentendre Skanzen. If you don\u2019t want to go to the Buda Castle by walk, then you can use the nearby Budapest Castle Hill Funicular. The kitchen is well-equipped, but if you do not feel like to make your dinner, you can eat one of the nearby restaurants, even a Michelin rated restaurant is just a few minutes walk away. You can explore the city from there really easily. In the gallery there is a double seized bed, but if you travel with an older child, then we can make the couch in the living room into comfortable bed. Free wifi in the apartment!!! And free parking outside the house (Until May 1. 2015), but we can\u2019t book a sure parking place to you!!

The district has great traditions. The local settlement of the Romans was destroyed by the Sarmatians in 3rd Century. In the Middle Ages a number of small settlements were developed in this area. The streets and buildings including the early 20th century block in which the apartment is situated really feels like cultural time travel :) The apartment is located at the foot of the Buda Castle Hill and an 8-10 minute pleasant walk will take you to the entrance of the Budapest tunnel, or, one of the jewels of our city, the beautiful Chain Bridge opposite the tunnel. You can also reach the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion and the Matthias church with a comfortable walk, and this is where you can get the best view of the city. But you will have the most spectacular view of our Parliament building on the Pest side from Batthy\u00e1ny Square a hundred metres from here. Professional photographers also take their lavish evening shots of the illuminated Parliament from Batthy\u00e1ny Square. The ten most famous places in town are within walking distance. Dine in one of the grand restaurants, there are a lot of them in our neighbourhood, and then take a walk along the banks of the Danube. It\u2019s a really romantic programme:)\n\nOr would you like to prepare your own dinner? \nYou can easily find the ingredients in the supermarket 100 metres from the apartment.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT\u00e9nyleg nagyon csendes \u00e9s biztons\u00e1gos, nyugodt k\u00f6rny\u00e9k, de m\u00e9g is a v\u00e1ros k\u00f6zep\u00e9n.

A good choice!\n\nGreat spot! Cool neighborhood near many attractions. For those sensitive to noise while sleeping, earplugs may be prudent, but a wonderful place to stay altogether, with communicative and helpful hosts.\n\nIt's a really beautiful place, just like the pictures! We really couldn't fault it - clean, warm, safe, great location...\nThe only thing is that a few special host 'insider tips' would have been great. \nWe definitely recommend taking the airport shuttle bus you can book from the airport, around HUF 4000 return and door to door service. Other recommendations - the river trip, Faust Cellar wine tour, Doblo wine bar, the baths! \n\nThe apartment looks great from the inside. Like literally as the pictures, the paintings are amazing. The location is alright, it's very close to the city centre, but the street it is located seemed a bit dodgy. Also several occasions we've had random people ringing the doorbell. There is a hostel on the first floor, the apartment is ok the ground floor, just be aware of that. However, all together the apartment itself is very nice.\n\nDon't let the state of the main entrance of the building scare you (kinda looks like an abandoned building from outside). The apartment is exactly as pictured if not better. It's quite spacious and very bright, adorable decor. Location is prime. Most places are walking distance. Close to St. Stephen's Basilica, several restaurants and pubs nearby. Occasionally you can hear some of the passerbyers in the street but it wasn't really noisy. The bed was comfy, heater worked well, nice big kitchen, big bathroom, awesome wifi. Loved it. The check in and check out process was easy breezy. I really recommend this place. \n\nLovely apartment in a great location. Really helpful with our arrival when we got there early. We didn't meet the owners directly but the two colleagues from the same company we spoke to/met were very helpful. I would really recommend this place. \n\nThe flat was lovely and extremely clean. We loved the quirky drawings on the walls! Meeting up to hand the key over went very smoothly. The flat was in a great location within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. Enjoyed having the Wifi.\n\nWe stayed in the apartment for 4 days and we had a really good time. The apartment is located perfectly and looks amazing! \n\nThe apartment was light and modern as seen in the pictures. The location was perfect, in close proximity to a great selection of bars, restaurants and shops. Patri and Akos were great hosts and were flexible on meeting times when we experienced travel delays.

Only I am living there in my own private room. The appartment is calm and just right temperatured.\n\nAs stated the appartment is shared, i am living there too. The appartment has windows on 3 sides to the courtyard of the house with huge trees, no street, usually no people, more like an atmosphere in the forest with birds and owls singing at 5 am.\n\nYour room has two beds for sleeping, two armchairs for relaxing/reading, and one table with an office chair for writing/working, there is also a TV inside your room, if you want to check out the news.\nA lot of poweroutlets are avaiable in the room, all hungarian (same as german) standard.\n\nThe kitchen is big with a table and four chairs, you can cook, use the fridge, but please clean the dishes afterwards, I expect my guests to be as clean as I am. The bathroom is shared, too. There is a shower, a sink, a toilet and there is a washing machine inside the bathroom.\n\nWe share the kitchen and the bathroom and you can go to the balcony if you want to sit outside, the balcony is at my room, if i am sleeping and you are quiet you can also go out to the balcony, as my sleep is quite good :)\n\nI can be your private guide, as I was to 100+ guests in Budapest already. Otherwise, if you want, I leave you alone. I am there or not, as you prefer. Usually during the day I am working, so no time usually, just in the mornings, evenings or weekends.\n\nThe best attraction which is located very close to the appartment is of course my vintage retro store which is something like a consignment store. Of course the danube is very close and you also need only a couple of minutes to the big market hall. You cross the danube to Buda and the Gellert hill is close with the Citadell and the Gellert spa. From there you can go to the castle and go back to the Pest side on the famous chainbridge. Not far from there you will find the parliament. And much more. Just ask me...\n\nThe public transport is very good in Budapest. Decide yourself if you want to buy a 10 ticket block or a 24h or for example 72h ticket, just dont get the Budapest Card, its a ripoff. Actually if you book this listing, you wont need public transport for your stay - walking rules in the city, even in rain!\n\nDon\u00b4t change money at the trainstation, international busstation or airport when you arrive, either take out money from the ATM or wait until you get into the inner city to go to a normal Exchange Office. They will rip you off at the main arrival points for tourists. Also at some inner city Exchange Offices. Many smaller shops in Budapest still have no electronic payment, so some cash is mandatory :)", "weekly_discount": "10%", "gym": false, "internet": true, "kitchen": true, "lift": false, "suitable_for_events": false, "air_conditioning": false, "name_of_district": "", "hair_dryer": true, "pool": false, "essentials": true, "hangers": true, "wheelchair_accessible": false, "host_description": "", "accuracy_rating": 10, "shampoo": true, "heating": true, "longitude": "19.05363677403551", "extra_people_charge": "\u20b4226 / night after the first guest", "url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3309579", "pets_allowed": false, "dryer": false, "cleaning_fee": null, "cancellation_type": "Moderate", "iron": true, "h24_check_in": false, "cleanliness_review": 9, "photo_urls": ["https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/52376927-c4f4-4b02-b634-75b8db0e955f.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f20150ab-8c17-46c8-8c0a-16f2bdddea1a.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/2bad5918-0bf7-41c2-8ef7-3b5a67b4773e.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7e38eb34-8ccc-47c9-b19e-cd5e8a884082.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3950085f-557e-4dee-babb-4aefea32fdcc.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/e1c2875c-65f0-4273-9c0f-cd7614cdbedc.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/43141409/7b6419ff_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/43141396/1a8de4b2_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/43141456/fce42d74_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/43141461/85826a69_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/43141471/78a49785_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/43141482/92d75ebf_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/43141488/a5b48e4f_original.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/43141374/21ace372_original.jpg?aki_policy=small"], "smoking_allowed": false, "room_type": "Private room", "wireless_internet": true},

We'd love to come back and stay again some day! \n\nVery nice apartment in an excellent location, everything is within walking distance. Metrostation is across the street, very good if you arrive by train (only 4 stops from Keleti).\nPlace looks exactly like on the photos - nice and clean. Would definitely recommend this place.\n\nVery nice place with a really cosy bed. Perfect location, close to sights and restaurants. \n\nThe appartement was very nice and clean, Magdi was very accommodating with our schedule. We spent a very good week end there, I recommend !\n\nLovely Home and nice Hello from the Owner!\r\nEverything fine!\r\nNice place near the Metro!\n\nWe really enjoyed our stay in Magdi's place and Budapest in general. The apartment itself is located in a neighborhood called Ruins which is filled with numerous bars and restaurants. Also it is really close to the the center of Budapest, basically in a walking distance to all the Budapest's main attractions. \r\nThe apartment is comfortable and full of sun, also fully equipped with all the necessities you would need. It has that great vintage vibe that I appreciate wherever I go. There is a huge fish tank in the living room that makes the apartment even more appealing. \r\nMagdi was kind enough to welcome us in the apartment when we arrived, unfortunately we couldn't spend a lot of time getting to know her better since we were in a rush to a concert. \r\nAll in  all, I would always come back to Magdi's place. :)\r\n\n\nMagdi was very flexible with our time of arrival and very nice. The apartment is beautiful, very cosy and warm. It has all things needed. Super close to the center and in front of the metro station (very nice and easy to get there from the airport). We have enjoyed our stay a lot and we fully recommend it to everyone. One of the nicest places we've stayed in. \n\nMagdi was an absolutely amazing host! She was very flexible about the check- in and out time.. The location was spot on - in the center of pest - the metro station just across the street - and the best view from the balcony! The apartment was even more beautiful than the pictures showed and very clean! \r\nWe loved Budapest!! Thank's Magdi for a wonderful stay! :)\n\nAn excellent apartment in an ideal and central location of Pest. \nClean, comfortable, a good view from the balcony, easy to walk everywhere (right opposite a Subway station in fact but I never needed to use it) and contains everything needed for cooking (again, not that I used it as Hungarian food is so good!)\nMagdi too was very helpful and communicated perfectly.\nAll brilliant and I loved Budapest! Thanks again Magdi \n\nVery nice place to stay. Pleasant, clean and close to everywhere.

The bed is comfortable and Attila makes sure you are comfortable.\n\nI was only checking in for short period so couldn't say much about the neighborhood other than that it seemed only a short distance from points of interest. The apartment itself is spacious and comfortable, and Attila was kind and communicative. Despite having to rush because of a delay on my part, he was helpful and cheerful when checking me in. Recommended.\n\nIt's a good budget accomodation close to the centre. Attila was flexible about early check in. Thanks Attila!\n\nThe apartment was nice and clean Close to the city center with the tram close by. We were allowed a late check out which was great. Thanks for everything :)\n\nAttila was a perfect host. He helped me with all the important stuff, since the trip from the airport to the house, to explain the best places to visit. \r\nThe house was exactly like in the photos. Beautiful and very Cozy.\r\nIf i come back to Budapest i would love to return to that house!", "accommodates": "4", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 4PM", "availability": "On Fridays and Saturdays the minimum stay is 2 nights.", "host_reviews": "57", "beds": "2", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/31135297", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": false, "review_summary": "A helyem a k\u00f6vetkez\u0151k k\u00f6zel\u00e9ben tal\u00e1lhat\u00f3: Lake Feneketlen \u00e9s A38 Haj\u00f3.

Highly recommended\n\nWe stayed here for 4 nights and it was exactly as it looks in the pictures - absolutely perfect! The location is ideal for sightseeing (we saw everything on foot) and also right next to great bars and restaurants (without any noise or disruption).

{"host_name": "Roland", "bathrooms": "1", "check_in_review": 9, "private_entrance": false, "location_review": "Budapest", "laptop_friendly_workspace": true, "reviews_text": "Roland's flat was amazing, very clean and extremely spacious. There were only two of us, but it could easily house 4 people. The neighbourhood is clean and quiet, and yet you are minutes away from the busy town centre.\r\n\r\nThe location could not have been better - 5 minutes to the river down the hill, 5 minutes up the stairs to the castle.\r\n\r\nI would defenitely recommend staying in this flat.\r\n\r\nThe host was also very quick to respond and very helpful with any questions we had prior and during the trip.\n\nSpacious and in a fantastic location for exploring the city, and within easy walking distance from key attractions and great restaurants. Having the river so close feels very special. One thing to note is that there is no shower, but the bathtub is huge and makes up for it!\n\nWe had a very good stay in Budapest. The appartement is well located and there is a lot of Space.\nI just regret the welcoming, meeting the host would be better to hav\u00e9 some advices for the city.\nThe Check out is early so i thune it's important that Roland find a solution to keep the luggage of the traveller's.\nThank \n\nNice location very near tourist spot\n\nRoland's apartment was big and comfortable and in a nice, central part of Budapest. We enjoyed our stay very much! The apartment can easily room four people and has most of things you could ask for. The entrance hall of the building is really amazing. All the practical things (key delivery etc.) worked out very smoothly. Really the only downside was a slight shortage of some kitchen utensils. Other than that I can recommend this place!\n\nWe did not get to meet Roland in person but he has a very nice and easy to use system to give the keys. The apartment was easy to find and just like the pictures. Can definitely recommend it for a trip to Budapest, great location close to the center and other sightseeing locations.\n\nThe flat is a really great size and in an amazing location within a short walk of the bridge. Roland kept in good contact with us before our stay and everything was ready in the flat when we arrived.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about the apartment is its size. This place is huge. Not only is it spacious, it is a beautifully decorated, clean and very tidy place to stay, immediately justifying its impressive value for money.\n\nThere were only two minor qualms we could think of. Firstly, if you're not comfortable with having no shower then this may be an issue. There is only a large bath with a shower head hanging free; not the end of the world but maybe annoying for some.\n\nSecondly, there are set of public steps outside that pass right by the bedroom window, but without any curtains or blinds, it may be a little unnerving for some being 'spied on' from outside.\n\nLocation wise the apartment is in a great place, albeit on the hilly Buda side of the city. Located right next to the famous chain bridge and the funicular railway to the top of the citadella, the apartment is in a prime location for the Buda side of the city, and only a 10 minute walk into the centre of Pest over the river.\n\nFurthermore, there is an inexpensive supermarket at the foot of the hill on the road where the apartment lies.\n\nInstructions left from the host were coherent and concise, making our arrival and departure an absolute breeze.\n\nThe apartment was excellent value for money, well located and these things coupled with a fantastic host made for an excellent stay in Budapest. (Oh and who can say no to a bottle of Hungarian wine left as a welcome gift!)\n\nRoland's apartment was a beautiful place to stay in Budapest, in a wonderful location.  It was within walking distance of all the areas we wished to visit.  The pictures truly describe how lovely the space is, and we were thrilled to come home to it each night after a long day out.  Roland made us feel very welcome with birthday wishes and a bottle of Hungarian wine.  He also arranged an early morning airport transfer for us on our last day, which was a tremendous help to make our travel easier.  We would hope to stay here again for any future travels to Budapest.\n\nThe apartment was even better than expected and very large. The four of us had a wonderful time staying here. Roland was very communicative over message and was there to answer every question that we had.

When we arrived Gabbi showed us on a map the key things to see during our time in Budapest and answered any questions we had. The apartment was well equipped and located. It was close to transport links but we were able to get to everywhere we wanted to on foot.\nWould highly recommend both Gabbi and her apartment.\n\nA fantastic, cosy Studio, centrally located made even better by the warm and friendly welcome we received. Gabi was very informative and gave great suggestions on things to see and do. \nThe Studio was the perfect place to come back to after braving the cold outside! \nHighly recommend staying here! \n\nWe had a wonderful time staying at Gabi's. The apartment was in very a good condition and was well located for exploring the city.\n\nGabi met us at the apartment and gave us plenty of 'insider tips' of where to go, what to do, what not to do, how much to expect to pay for things, which was all really helpful.\n\nWe loved budapest and would highly recommend Novak Studio as an Airbnb apartment!\n\nWhat a great place to stay.  The apartment was clean and well appointed and the location was fantastic.  Met by Anika who gave us an excellent introduction to Budapest.  Anika and Gabi were very helpful.  Right around the corner from some excellent Hungarian restaurants.  So good we never cooked a meal at the apartment.  Would definately recommend this spot when visiting Budapest.\n\nExcellent location and hostess, would 100% return !\n\nWe arrived late because of flight delay and our fault as well,  Gabriella waited for us at the apartment until we arrived and explained everything about the apartment and trip options in the city until we understood everything. She was also available during our stay via the airbnb site and helped us. A 5 \n\nWe were made to feel very welcome with plenty of information about the city given to us. The location was perfect. Gabriella was very helpful with advising us on transport around the city and to the airport.\n\nWe could not recommend Gabi's place more! The place is really lovely and had everything we needed - easy access to everything, perfect location, and Gabi is amazing - the most wonderful host. We loved Budapest and our time here was all the better by being at Gabi's flat- thank you!\n\nThe apartment is right in the heart of Budapest but equally in a neighbourhood that isn't noisy at night which is more than ideal. Walking distance from most things and with a convenient tube station less than 25m away. The apartment itself is incredible and exactly how it looks in the photos. Pretty much perfect for romantic getaways and the best thing to come back to at the end of each evening. Upon arrival Gabi is friendly and very welcoming, giving a quick rundown of where things are and throwing in some pretty worthwhile recommendations of what to explore. Overall was exceptionally happy with staying here and would recommend to anyone. \n\nWe had a great stay and the host was absolutely brilliant \r\nGreat location. \r\nWe enjoyed our stay. \r\nThank u Gabi", "accommodates": "4", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 2PM", "availability": "The minimum night stay for this listing varies.", "host_reviews": "219", "beds": "4", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/6484250", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": true, "review_summary": "Cosy and renew splitlevel studioapartment in the downtown at K\u00e1lvin,a perfect base for your sightseeing, business, study or anniversary trip to Budapest, provides comfy stay for 2-3 people.

The location was great with amazing views and such a quiet location. We used the buses and trams but mainly walked everywhere. Had a great time at the spar near heroes square then went skating in the park near by. We visited everything we wanted to over 3 days. \n\n\nEverything is as described. Good historical building. Peter picked us up at train station and tour around city a bit. Very nice of him. \nSmall issue was the lock was broken when we went out one morning, Kati sent a person to fix immediately in 5mins so we managed to go out in a short time. Thumbs up to their efficiency. \n\nIf you want to discover Budapest, this apartment is an ideal place to stay. The view is extremely beautiful and everything in walking distance. The apartment is beautifull  decorated and has everything you need. And Peter gave me some good advice about places to go and things to do. \nKati I did not meet, but was quickly answering if I had any questions. I would definitely recommend this place for people wanting to visit Budapest. \n\nDream city break! We had already read the amazing reviews so felt confident this trip was going to be a good one but it turned out to be even better. \r\n\r\nPeter and Kati couldn't have been better hosts. Kati was brilliant and answering my many questions and was always on hand to help. Peter collected us from the hotel with a guided tour of the city so by the time we were shown around the stunning flat we were so excited to begin our holiday. \r\n\r\nBudapest is an extremely easy city to walk around but Peter showed us how we can simply jump on the bus or metro from where the flat is. \r\n\r\nThe bed is the comfiest bed we've slept in and the view from the window is breathtaking.\r\n\r\nThanks for such a memorable stay Kati and Peter and for all the little extras that made the trip one of our all time favourites. \r\n\r\nWill and Tash x\r\n\n\nThis flat is amazing with a stunning view. The location couldn't have been better! Walking distance to all major cites in the city, and situated right on the Danube. The hosts are quick to respond, attentive and offer any help you may need. Their shuttle service to the airport is also recommended. The bed isn't the most comfortable, but other than that the place is perfect. All in all, a great place to stay for one or two people visiting Budapest!\n\nHighly recommend staying here. The place is beautiful and the location is unbelievably convenient. Kati and Peter are very nice and helpful. Don't hesitate to book! \n\nWe had a wonderful stay at Kati's place.  Kati and Peter are awesome hosts and very responsive and helpful.  The place is in a great location right on the Danube and offers fantastic views of the \"Pest\" side of the city, especially at night with everything lit up.  The Chain Bridge is only steps away to get across the river to take in other sights.  On the Buda side there's plenty of attractions nearby, we also found some great dining and one of the best pubs I've ever been in.  Budapest is a terrific city to visit, and my only advice is to spend enough time to do the place justice.  \n\nOur favourite Airbnb so far. The apartment is beautiful, the view is impeccable and Kati and Peter are gracious hosts. Our trip to Budapest was in incredible and the Apartment only made it more so. Can't recommend it enough! \n\nHost was very accommodating.  Saw our river boat from their window and called to arrange to pick us up.  Took us on a tour of the neighborhood - restaurants, grocery, etc.  Also took us to the airport.  Great views from the apt and walking distance to all sites and if instead, you wanted public transportation; it was conveniently located.\n\n\nThe best location in Budapest,by far. The tag is misleading the spectacular view-breathtaking in the dark- is of PEST, the  apt is on the BUDA side, right under the castle and a block from the Chain bridge, From there, you can ride the funicular, or take a bus , hop the tram or just walk across, as we did, If you have coffee and  great cake at the tiny cafe next to Marvelosa restaurant, the charming owner will tell you how to ride up to the castle for free,There are a half dozen terrific places to eat within a 10 minute walk . Walk 20 mins you ll have a choice of about 20. \n\nTake Peter's offer of a pickup at the airport or train, it will save you a fortune, and for the small price he charges\nyou will get a great orientation to the city. He rode us all through the city, providing some history and good \nsuggestions for where to eat and where to visit, a wonderful way to start our visit,\n\nWe only met Kati and her beautiful children for a few minutes due to a big family event, but she is great at communicating, \n\nWe loved it, If we ever get to return , we'll stay here.

Thus the apartment emits an eclectic vibe: it is both classic and modern, bohemian and reliable at the same time. P\u00e9ter is an artist who has been making fire enamel paintings for 25 years, and his works of art have a quality guarantee of 500 years.

Will be back!\n\nPerfect apartment for exploring Budapest, immaculately decorated, well thought out and very clean. We walked everywhere and it's very close to some fantastic bars and restaurants. Great communication from the host- would recommend. Some loud music from downstairs bar on last night. \n\nThe flat is awesome and the situation of it is central. It's really easy to find the apartment. Timi&Istvan's indications are perfect. The decoration in the flat is simple and beautiful. The bathtub in the bedroom is really cool. The plus is the bicycle pass, we use it everyday. The iMac is very practical too. We really enjoyed our stay in Budapest thanks to Timi&Istvan !\n\nIn 2 words: Amazing experience\nThe apartment is exactly as you can see on the pictures, very clean and organized, very close to some nice ruins pubs and the vibrant Jewish district.\nIstvan is very helpful and answer our messages immediately.\nWe will defiantly will stay there on our next visit to Budapest.\n\nExcellent apartment to discover Budapest! Istvan was always making sure we have a lovely Holiday and even called a Taxi to pick us from the airport :)\n\nDefinitely one of the most accurately described airbnb listings. The hosts were so responsive from start to end, and gave clear instructions on how to enter the place. At some point, I had to change my listing dates and they were really flexible with it. Incredibly accomodating! But I guess the real winner for me with Timi and Istvan's listing is how truly beautiful and Instagram worthy this place is :) loved it.\n\nWe had a very warm welcome ( literally) when we arrived because the heater was on; lovely on a cold evening in November.\nThe appartment is very spacious and clean, perfect situated (the Jewish quarter is very nice) and fully equipped. The shower has got two different heads (rain and normal), the floor is heated, the bed is very comfortable. The bath is a lovely bonus with these temperatures. \nThe windows are at the street side, so it can be a little noisy. The subway, shops, many tourist attractions, restaurants and bars are closeby! We did everything by foot or bicycle; only used the subway to come and go to the airport. \n\nIstvan is a very good host; we received clear indications to reach and use the apartment and the bicycles. Istvan  solved the WiFi problem within half an hour after we informed him about it. \n\nWe booked for the first time on Airbnb and it was a warm acquaintance; we will definitely book this appartment again. \nI highly recommend this place to all couples who want to discover Budapest :)\n\n\nThe apartment was amazing - clean, modern, cosy and right in the middle of the city. The bathtub in the bedroom was a fun element. Timi was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed and made our stay just perfect. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!

The communication is problem free. The flat is very clean and well equipped. The location is very good. We has felt here very well.\n\nThis clean well equipped apartment is in a great location. Balazs was very welcoming, friendly and accommodating. Would definitely recommend this one.\n\nNice place in great location. Good communication from owner when had a problem with wifi and was resolved in a day. The rooftop terrace is actually a balcony to the inner courtyard of the building.\n\nApartment corresponds to the description. Very well located. Everything is at walking distance. You will enjoy your staying.\n\nWe stayed in Balazs and Fani's lovely apartment for six days in September.  Its huge, definitely large enough to accommodate two couples or a family, and its in a great neighbourhood. It has a full kitchen and two lovely bathrooms, with all of the associated amenities you could possibly need (including a washing machine and a hairdryer). \r\n\r\nBeing just five minutes walk from Nyugati train station, all public transport options are easy to access. We loved being in this neighbourhood too - there were several supermarkets within 2-3 min walk from the apartment, as well as some great local places to eat (including Haveli - indian food - and Local Korner - pizza). If you're into board games, there's a great shop just along the street, and 10min walk away, a place called Game Up Pub, where you can play games and drink lovely beers! The apartment in the perfect location for exploring the city by foot - we walked everywhere, including to Margaret Island, and over the Chain Bridge to Buda. Bring comfy shoes, and get walking!\r\n\r\nBalazs was very responsive to emails and texts, and was there to greet us when we arrived. He, Fani and their lovely son came to say goodbye when we left, and they even booked us a taxi to the airport, which was hugely appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe fell in love with Budapest on this trip, and a huge part of that was due to this lovely apartment. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a home from home along the Danube\n\nWe had a wonderful stay at Balazs. Definitely amazing! The house is huge and safe, with comfortable beds, well-equipped bathrooms and kitchen. They are so considerate that they had everything prepared(towels, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, etc. and they are of great quality!). Personally I do like the kitchen-clean, modern and easy to use. The snacks(musli and peanuts) and Hungarian wine and drinks in the refrigerator are what makes this stay even better! The location is superb! Metro line 1/3 are within walking distance. Quite a few mini/super markets are nearby, so are all kinds of restaurants. Highly recommended, if you want a decent and comfortable stay in Budapest!\n\nBalasz has been the greatest help for my staying in Budapest. \r\nApartment is on the top floor with terrace inside the apartment complex. Very quiet apartment, total of 3 A/C available in each room.\r\nKitchen stuff are not maximum equipped but enough to cook and serve people. \r\nClean, new apartment fresh renovated with nice view from window of top floor. Apartment was great, but more than that, I am very thankful to the host himself! I had fun staying there. Thank you! \r\n\n\nWhen I booked Balazs's place he didn't have any reviews so I was a little worried, but in the end it turned out to be better than I expected.\r\nI was on a business trip and had little time to look for places, so I had to book him in a rush, but it wasn't a problem for him.\r\n The apartment is almost brand new, there were some design parts, which I particularly liked. The terrace is neat, on the fifth floor, no one can bother you there.\r\n The bedrooms are quiet, you cannot hear the street noises.\r\n The kitchen is fully equipped, you could live here for a longer period as well. There were some snacks and drinks in the fridge.\r\n Balazs offered a friend who is a professional tourguide, but I didn't have time to spend days to visit the town so they offered to come to the appartment and show some \r\n traditional hungarian cuisine, so the friend teached me how to make some excellent food.\r\n He has an Italian neighbor by the terrace, who wasn't home most of the time, but when we met one evening, he was extremely easy going and we had some nice talk.\r\n Balazs is not living around, he only come to let me in and check me out. It seemed that the cleanness is very important for him, he also made sure to give hotel quality \r\n towels, bed-linen and a tons of other bathroom garments. Definitely recommended, for this price at this location this is a perfect place for business travelers or even for friends.\r\n The atmosphere and the extra things (like the cooking lesson at home) makes this place a unique one.\n\nBalaz was a really nice host. Very helpful and friendly, answered fast and was easy to communicate with. The apartment was very nice and clean. In the fridge there was some juice and on the toilet there where toothpastes, shampoos and so on. Very nice.

Orsi was so kind and easy to speak to, we had the loveliest time. Loads of bars and restaurants near by, you can't go wrong . Thanks for having us!! \n\nWe loved our three nights stay in this wonderful apartment! It was in a great, central location within walking distance to many interesting bars and restaurants which were just around the corner. When we arrived, Orsi recommended two places for dinner - which did not disappoint! The apartment was kept toasty and warm despite it being freezing (& very windy!) outside in the evenings, and we found all the basic amenities available for us to use. We will definately be recommending this place to friends and family should they ever visit Budapest, and we would love to return again some day. A perfect host. Thank you very much! Dawn and Elliot \n\nOrsi and Balazs place is a great apartment at the tip top of an apartment block a short walk away from the amazing Ruin's bars of Budapest. Its quiet and relaxing at night and has everything you need with a fully equipped kitchen and was warm, comfortable and cosy when we visited in November. You only have to read the chalk board covered with messages from happy visitors to know that this is a special place that people have enjoyed being in. Orsi was a great host and met us with the key when we arrived late in the evening, ran us through the apartment and some favourite places in Budapest and then left us to it- but she was easily reachable and not far away if needed - perfect! \n\nRight away from check-in, Orsi provided a warm welcome when I met her at the loft. She gave a great rundown of the city and expectations for the apartment.\n\nHer recommendations for how to get to the apartment from the airport, which sites to see, and where to eat were all on point. I want to confirm that K\u00f6leves Vend\u00e9gl\u00f6 and Gett\u00f3 Guly\u00e1s are both fantastic places to eat within a quick walk of her apartment. \n\nThe apartment itself has a great energy, just like Orsi herself. It has bohemian/worldly type of decorations placed in a modern, clean apartment. The lofted bed makes you feel like you're in a treehouse, coupled with a rocking chair/reading nook. The best part of the decor was her black chalkboard in the kitchen (great alternative to a guest book) that had positive messages from fellow travelers who previously stayed at Orsi's place. \n\nIf I ever make it back to Budapest, I'm definitely going to stay at Orsi's apartment again. Without question. And I highly recommend that you do the same. \n\nOur whole experience from booking to leaving was fantastic.  Orsi would respond immediately to any messages sent, was very accommodating to our arrival and departure times and made us feel very welcome.  The apartment was so cute and quirky.  It was spotlessly clean, comfortable and so central for a host of restaurants and bars.  We had a fabulous time and would highly recommend this apartment.  It was like a home away from home and we will definitely be back in the summer.\n\nAlthough just for 1 night, accommodation at Orsi was a unique experience. Very cosy, clean and stylish. Thank you Orsi.\n\nVery nice place in the middle of everything in Budapest. Everything worked very simple and easy. Very good stay for a weekend trip to Budapest. \n\nThis is a wonderful place. The flat is absolutely lovely! Also, The host is incredible nice and helpful. I Highly recommend it! \n\nOrsi's place is amazing. So central, great decor and even better host. Orsi was able to answer any questions which allowed us to have a fantastic time. Thanks Orsi!!\n\nWe've spent a nice moment in the flat and we had a very warm welcome. There was a bit too much light from the outdoors even with the curtains, but we enjoyed our stay. The neighbourhood is fantastic.\r\n\r\nThank you for the warm welcoming;\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nPaloma", "accommodates": "3", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 2PM", "availability": "2 nights minimum stay", "host_reviews": "164", "beds": "2", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/21555588", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": true, "review_summary": "It's a real shelter!...and your true home away home.\nA quite, cozy bohemian style 5th floor apartment in the vivid heart of the city with balcony view to the cozy rooftops...\nThe best cultural places & popular ruin bars are just in a stone's throw!", "TV": true, "indoor_fireplace": false, "response_date": "", "communication_review": 10, "free_parking_on_premises": false, "response_time": "", "family_or_kid_friendly": false, "latitude": "47.49457993877107", "washer": true, "monthly_discount": "10%", "cable_TV": true, "house_rules": "A lot of elder people lives in this house, so please RESPECT THE SILENCE hours from 10 pm till 8 am, and BE POLITE with the other residents. \n\nRECYCLE!  :)\nHungary is just trying to grow up to be more environmental, and for that there are extra containers in the house for RECYCLING plastic, and paper+metal waste, so please try to collect your waste selectively too.\n\nSMOKING\nOn the balcony (corridor), in front of the apartment's window there is a small table with chairs, there you can smoke.

The biggest synagogue in Hungary, the Gozsdu-yard, and the famous and luxurious New York Palace are in a light walk away. Nowadays this inner part of the district is more mentioned as the \"Ruin bar\" or \"Party\" district, because here is the most vivid nightlife in the city. Lots of very good ruinbars and restaurants are in just 5-10 minutes walk from the apartment.\n\nThe other side, the Palace district is a real cultural recreation, it got the name because here were built the luxurious palaces of the old aristocrats, esquires and lords of Hungary during the 19th century by noble architects like Mikl\u00f3s Ybl or J\u00f3zsef Hild. So this area abounds of architectural sights like the neighboring beautiful art nouveau building of the Ur\u00e1nia National Film Theater . \nThe top of that there is the National Museum of Hungary which is in 5 minutes walk from the accommodation.\n\nPUBLIC TRANSPORT IS PERFECT in this area.\nHere goes the R\u00e1kczi Street (which is one of the biggest avenues) and the two big boulevards of the city.\n\nRight on the corner there is the BUST STOPS for several buses which are crossing the downtown and go to the Buda side so you can reach the Gell\u00e9rt-hill in less than 10 minutes, and the Buda Castle in 15 minutes. \n\nThe METRO line 2 and line 4 are in 4-5 minutes walk, and the station of line 3 in 10 minutes walk. The main TRAM line (nr 4-6) is also reachable in 4-5 minutes. \n\nThe PUBLIC BIKE system \"Bubi\" is right on the corner.\n\nThe KELETI RAILWAY-STATION is a 20-minute-walk, 5 minutes by bus (lines 7, 178, 5, 8...) or by metro line M2 to \"Blaha Lujza t\u00e9r\" and from there 4 minutes extra walk. \nThe NYUGATI RAILWAY-STATION 10 minutes with tram nr 4-6 from the stop Nyugati Railwaystation to \"Balaha Lujza t\u00e9r\" and 4 minute extra walk to the house. \n\nFrom the LISZT FERENC AIRPORT it takes around 45 minutes. With public-transport take the Airport bus line 200E to the metro station of \"K\u0151b\u00e1nya-Kistpest\", take the metro line M3 till \"Ferenciek tere\" and you can walk approximately 500 meters along the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Street or you can take a bus till the 2nd stop,\"Ur\u00e1nia\".  \nYou can come by taxi or take the service of the airport shuttle service (for more info please visit the Budapest Airport's website)\n\nIn the downtown there is only PAY PARKING from 8 am to 8 pm weekdays.

The room is really tiny, but the two-story structure gives it some space and makes the room feel cozy. The size of the bed is 140 x 220 cm.\n\nThe flat is fully equipped for everyday life and you can use and share everything in the apartment.\n\nI will give you towels, tissues, lots of pillows, and extra covers, and there is a shelf, a drawer, and some hooks and clothes-hangers for your stuff.\n\nI usually leave some foreign language books on the bedside shelf for the guests, if they want to read a bit before sleeping. :)\n\nThe house was built at the turn of the century with a really high ceiling and big windows so the flat is really spacious and bright. The living room and the other two bedrooms face south, so there is usually sun shining in during the whole day. There is plenty of room in the kitchen too, for cooking and eating.\n\nThe flat is well located (the metro line M3 is just around the corner) and you can basically reach all the sights and interesting parts of the city in less than 30 minutes by public transport.\n\nJust right next to the building's gate, there is a little food store where you can get anything that you need right away. The owners are good friends of ours and they're very kind people. Next to the store, there is the area's pharmacy, hopefully you won't need that.\n\nThe flat is very spacious, and you are very welcome to make yourself at home.\n\nThere is a fully-equipped kitchen where your will be given a shelf in the fridge and in the kitchen cabinet for your food. You will also get a shelf in the bathroom so you can store your stuff there conveniently.\n\nYou are welcome to make use of the space and the music equipment in the living room as well.\n\nIf you're up for it, and I have the time I can gladly show you around and take you to some well-known or less-known places. But even if I'm not around I can give you a handful of tips about the city.\n\nThe area is an upcoming neighborhood and there are some nice bars and caf\u00e9s in the neighboring streets offering hand-crafted beer and local wines.\n\nThe Trafo house of contemporary arts is at walking distance, and there is usually always something good going on there.\n\nThere is a newly renovated area \"Corvin Negyed\" starting a few streets away, with pubs, cafes, and shops, and with one of the oldest cinema buildings (Corvin Mozi) in the city. It also has a historical connotation, as it was one of the main locations of the  Hungarian revolution in 1956.\n\nThere is also a big park and a botanic garden nearby.\n\nWhat I like about this area is that it's completely mixed, you can really meet all sorts of different things and people on the streets.\n\nThe metro line M3 is just around the corner (2-3 minutes walking). It will take you to De\u00e1k Ferenc square in about 10 minutes (4 stops), which is the ultimate centre of Pest in many ways. From there, you can basically reach every important point of Pest very easily.\n\nThe tram line 4-6 is also at walking distance (or 1 metro stop) which is a very useful line for getting around in Budapest, it goes right across the city in a half-circle, and it goes 24/7.\n\nThere are night buses as well, going from \u00dcll\u0151i \u00fat (about 3 minutes walking) every 15 minutes, so the place is also well-connected during the night.\n\nWe don't smoke inside the flat, but settled a little smoking-talking area by the door on the balcony with two chairs, flowers, and candles.

You can reach all the center on foot. Host is very helpful and kind :) I liked the stereo which made it even more cozy. \n\nThe apartment is very cozy, the description coincides with the reality. The situation is perfect to visit Budapest walking, because it is very central, near to the main tourist attractions and transport. Dorisz and Gery were very nice, and they helped us in everything!\n\nDorisz and Gery make us feeling at home in their apartment! Amazing accomodation in a really good location in Pest: near to the main tourist attractions and transport. I would highly reccomend this apartment for enjoying Budapest. \n\nA friend and I had a fantastic stay at Dorisz's apartment whilst travelling around Europe. The apartment was clean and in an amazing location. We were also welcomed by Dorisz's boyfriend Gary who showed us around the apartment and marked up a map of the best places to go in the area! All in all we had a fantastic stay in Budapest and would stay at Dorisz's apartment again!\n\nFirst time in Budapest. When we arrived to the apartment we were met by the nice owners. They introduced us to the city and the apartment. The placement is amazing, it is in the centrum of the city. We would recommend the apartment :) \n\nI would highly recommend this apartment due to its convenient location to all of the main sights, the amenities at the apartment, and the price.  The host picked me up from the airport and gave me a full overview of the apartment.  Overall, the host was exceptionally welcoming and made me feel comfortable very quickly.  \n\nDorisz was waiting for us at the apartment.

Everything is similar to what is shown in the pictures.\r\nThere were many shops and transports close to the place.\r\nThank you!\n\nGreat flat right in perfect location. The flat was very clean and has a great view to a square. It is also very bright and spacious (except for the bedroom, which is quite small). The kitchen is well equipped. The owners were very friendly and accessible. The important information on the fridge was a nice touch. My only suggestion would be to have extra sets of keys, so that guests can have more flexibility in coming back to the flat at different times.\n\nDorisz made us feel immediately at home on arriving and helped us decide on where to eat and explore. The flat was incredibly clean and comfortable in a very central location.

There is a supermarket 2-minute walk from the apartment, and Duna plaza mall a 10 minute walk away. \r\n\r\nThe morning run on the river.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this apartment to anybody visiting Budapest and values piece and quite. \r\n\n\nWe had a great stay here.  The apartment is just what we expected with a fabulous view over the Danube from the balcony.  If you have a car there is an excellent, safe, clean garage under the apartments.  The Metro is only a 5 minute walk away which will get you in to the city centre in under 15 mins. Local shops are close by with bigger supermarkets [Tesco Extra] within a 5 minute drive.The apartment has all the things you need and the beds are very comfy and the water hot.  Bence [Bente] is a great host and he and Niki made us very welcome and kept in contact with us while we were in Budapest. Excellent Bence - may thanks.\n\nBeautiful apartment overlooking the Danube. Hosts had provided thoughtful extras and Dorina was lovely and really easy to communicate with. Good location, although not central, a short walk and you are at the metro and into the centre. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend. \n\nThe apartement was wonderful with a lovely view at Donau. Bence had arranged someone to wait for us although we came very late. \r\nEverything was just fine and we had a lovely holiday.\r\nBence was a nice host and wrote several times just to ask if we were ok. Thank you. :-)\n\nbence is a wonderful guy ,apartment is beautiful  as on photos ,but if you expect an good air conditioning system then look somewhere else, temperature never goes down below 28 Celsius,\n\nBence's place was everything that was described in the listing. He had it well stocked and prepared both rooms for our stay. The view was amazing and it was within a 10 minute walk to the metro. We used the metro to get to all of the major tourist attractions and was easy to use. I would absolutely recommend staying here!\n\nBence was a brilliant host. Made sure our stay here went as smoothly as we could hope and hugely contributed to making Hungary such a good place to visit. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Hungary \n\nBence was an amazing host who accommodated our every need. He even went above and beyond when we were running behind schedule and picked up some local goulash and a bottle of wine for us to enjoy upon late arrival.  Later during the stay he was able to help us with ordering pizza from one of the incredibly useful information sheets he had posted in the kitchen for us to familiarize ourselves with the area.\r\n\r\nOn to the home:\r\n\r\nThe apartment feels brand new inside and is nicely appointed with amenities like a wine cooler, air conditioning, coffee maker, and a washing machine to do laundry in case it's necessary.  The major selling point would be the view and balcony as shown in the many pictures, but another good point is the open feeling and the view from both bedroom windows as well as the LARGE private parking spot in the garage (accommodated my lifted Toyota Tacoma with no issues. I believe it is 2.0m tall).  We felt very safe in the immediate area and enjoyed walking on the boardwalk on the Danube and also the two children's playgrounds on the boardwalk. \r\n\r\nThe only possible downside is the distance from downtown.  Cab rides ranged from about 10-20 USD depending on time of day and traffic, but all cab drivers were able to readily identify the apartment by saying \"Marina Part\" and the building number. As another side note, every cab driver commented on the wealth of the neighborhood for which the apartment is located.  Really enjoyed our stay and would come back to this apartment for sure if we make the long drive again.\n\nReally great apartment ! We were 4 friends and it was perfect. The view is splendid, the Danube down your feet. Look at the boats passing, while the sun is going down with a fresh beer or local wine and you will live a great moment ! Bence is friendly and professional. He gave us places to see and told us how to get there. You can take a taxi (2000 Forints to get to the center) or the metro (a less than ten minutes walk from the apartment). If you want to visit Budapest with a nice place to sleep in, this one is made for you ! Thanks Bence !\n\nWe loved staying in this apartment. It gave us everything we expected.

The communication with Angela from the very start was great. The apartment was very clean, had everything in it that we needed and more importantly, it felt very homely. Unfortunately whilst in Budapest my girlfriend became ill and Angela was very caring and helpful during this time. I highly recommend this apartment to any couple wanting to visit Budapest. Superb value for money. \n\n\nAngela is a great host. Check in was smooth and she explained how things work. Also told us about the neighborhood in detail including transport options.  A 10 Mins walk from Keleti and 15 mins from Heroes Sqaure, its convenient option for a short stay and value for money. Bathroom is very clean. kitchen is well equipped. The room is cozy. Overall a good experience. \n\nAngela and her place were amazing!!  She was such a gracious host, explaining everything about the apartment and even welcomed us for New Years with a bottle of bubbly!  Even though the kitchen was small, it was very well stocked and we had no problem cooking a delicious meal for ourselves.  The bedroom/living space was cozy and comfortable and the bathroom was very clean and spacious!  Everything about our stay was absolutely perfect!  Angela was so kind and very accommodating with arrival, departures, and tourism info.  And, to top it off, a great location!!  Book this place now.\n\nThis was my  first stay with Airbnb, and I had a really good experience.  I was totally satisfied with the apartment .The apartment is situated in a nice, quiet area.It is just a short walk from Heroes' Square,and the metro station so a great location, even the centre was  only a short bus ride. On arrival I  met  Angela, and I was greeted with a glass of mulled wine, which I appreciated a lot. She explained a fewthings about the apartment, and gave me tips about restaurants and ruinbars in the area and made me feel totally welcome. She was really helpful and friendly. She recommended places to visit. The flat was spotlessly clean, beautiful, nicely decorated and comfortable. The wifi connection was great.

Thanks again for a great weekend, Gabor.   \n\nThis was truly a beautiful and very safe place to stay. This was my first trip to Hungary and I stayed here for two weeks. The place was extremely well cleaned when I arrived. The host made sure someone was there to give me a set of keys and explain the basics despite my late arrival. The decor is as pictured. The kitchen was stocked with basics but lacked an oven. If I wanted anything cleaned all I had to do was ask and it was done promptly. The shower and sauna were amazing and I used both almost everyday. The hot water would occasionally not be available at night for some reason. I tried to use the big bath tub several times but couldn't get enough hot water to fill it up even halfway, but I only tried using it at night. Overall a great establishment very close to everything with great hosts. I highly recommend this place to anyone. \n\nI stayed at Gabor's with my partner and we both loved the place. It is a gorgeous apartment, very luminous and clean. It has a well equipped kitchen and the sauna and bathtub were a real treat. \nAlso, the location was super convenient and we could walk everywhere. \nAbout Gabor, our host, we can only say big thank you!! He was incredibly helpful and friendly, we will never forget his hospitality. \n\nVery nice apartment in the center of Budapest, located in quiet area, walking distance everywhere. The place was nicely furbished, clean, with a huge bathroom ;). Gabor is a great host and I would recommend the place to anyone visiting Budapest.\n\nGabor is an amazing host and he provides an absolutely beautiful apartment.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment was clean, quiet and roomy with a private water closet and a separate, very fashionable spa that includes a sauna! The apartment is in a convenient location.  We were able to walk everywhere we wanted go - sightseeing, shopping, restaurants.\r\n\r\nGabor helped arrange a guide for us.  He also arranged for us to be picked up at the train station.\n\nGabor was a great host.  I was born in Hungary and left as a child, so he went out of his way to buy me some of my favorite childhood treats that I remembered from 30 years ago!! :)\r\n\r\nThe apartment was very clean, bright, modern, and elegant.  The location is super convenient close to the Chain Bridge and many restaurants and tourist destinations.  It was  little hard to find, as the building entrance is not very well marked.  \r\n\r\nA potential visitor may keep in mind that this apartment doesn't have air conditioning, so on really hot summer nights like we had, this may be a problem for you as it was for me.  Also, make sure you bring a flashlight or your cell phone, as the entrance and foyer are not lit up at night, so it is very dark to make your way to the apartment.   Maybe Gabor can add some motion detection lighting in the wall for tenants coming in at night!\r\n\r\nOverall, a great host and a really classy, nice place to stay!  I would definitely recommend\n\nDie Wohnung war sehr sch\u00f6n, frisch renoviert und sauber. Au\u00dferdem liegt sie in einem wunderbaren historischen, sehr gepflegten Geb\u00e4ude. Es ist auch eine Tiefgarage vorhanden. Auch die Lage ist prima. Gabor war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Er hat uns sogar zu einer Party im Haus eingeladen und f\u00fcr die G\u00e4ste selbst gekocht. Deshalb kann ich die Wohnung sehr herzlich empfehlen!", "accommodates": "2", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Villa", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 2PM", "availability": "1 night minimum stay", "host_reviews": "39", "beds": "1", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/34985290", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": false, "review_summary": "The perfect starting point for a wonderful sightseeing! \nA high level of comfort and safety for perfect relaxation !\nThe apartment is on the first floor of a beautiful two-storey villa.", "TV": true, "indoor_fireplace": false, "response_date": "", "communication_review": 10, "free_parking_on_premises": false, "response_time": "", "family_or_kid_friendly": true, "latitude": "47.5006880565016", "washer": true, "monthly_discount": "15%", "cable_TV": true, "house_rules": null, "description": "The perfect starting point for a wonderful sightseeing! \nA high level of comfort and safety for perfect relaxation !\nThe apartment is on the first floor of a beautiful two-storey villa.\n\nThe apartment is on the first floor of a beautiful 2-storey villa were found.

The building can seem a bit shabby but the apartment itself is nice. The host lives next door. Thanks Laszlo! \n\nLaszlo was great, he made time to explain everything and meet myself and my friends even though we arrived at different times of the day. He was always a phone call or message away. He made sure we had everything we needed. The apartment was about 5 minutes from Tesco, 10 minutes to the main road and 20 mins to the main square. The main train station isn't too far away either. Transportation is super cheap compare to taxi. Overall, it was a great trip! Thanks for the wonderful host!!\n\nThe apartment was really nice.

Good location within walking distance of loads of shops and restaurants but there is also the metro and trams right on your doorstep too if you need it. Thank you so much Laszlo! Rachel and Tom\n\nLaszlo is a very attentive and helpful host. The flat is spacious, very clean and comfortable, it has all you need to feel yourself like a local.

Nevertheless, we would definitely recommend staying at Laszlo's place!\n\nThe communication prior to my arrival was great and Laszlo provided many helpful information on how to transfer from and to the airport. The apartment was exactly as described in the listing and as shown on the photos. Quiet, clean and located in about 10min walking distance from the VII. quarter with all the bars a restaurants. The Metro to down town is about 5min away. The host was available for any questions I had as he lives next door and he provided me with a great welcoming package as well.

The location is excellent, all within walking distance of the main restaurants/markets/bars. Krisztina as a host was incredibly reliable and was always available to contact if we needed anything.

Even though the location was central and lively but our apartment was quiet which was perfect.  The beds and pillows comfortable for a good nights rest so we could charge up for exploring lovely Budapest.  We loved all the shops and restaurants outside our building--the location is excellent.  Everything we wanted to do was 10 minutes away either by foot, taxi or public transportation.  Thank you for being a great host. \n\nI had a great stay in Krisztina's apartment, it was very comfortable and had everything I needed.\r\nThe location is good too, close to public transport with a number of decent restaurants close by and in easy walking distance to the main sights.

The flat does look even better that on the pictures.\n\nThe house made us feel very welcome. Even nicer than the pictures and the neighbourhood very nice and in a very centric area. Great location!

Her description of how to get to her place was accurate (we never did meet her however). For the price, it is hard to beat.\n\nWe had a fantastic week in Budapest and used many of Kata's recommendations (Szimpla Kert was a fun place for drinks and we got a delicious pizza just outside the flat one evening when we were tired). \nThe place was super clean and the courtyard was gorgeous! The flat is a 20 minute walk from heros square which is right next to the amazing baths! Transport in Budapest is super and we had no problem getting around with the help of maps and books from Kata's flat. Couldn't recommend this place more to anyone hoping to stay in the beautiful city of Budapest. \nTessa and Charles x  \n\nKata's place was great, and well placed for transport and access to great parts of Budapest. She was a fantastic host - even had snacks and things for me when I arrived - and responded quickly to any questions I had. The building was nice, quiet, and comfortable. Would definitely stay again. Thanks, Kata.\n\nIt was a great stay that I've ever done. The landlady was really nice . I hope everyone could have a stay experience there who could go to Budapest.\n\nBest holidays ever\n\nHad a lovely stay. Great set up and excellent location! Kata was friendly and communicative and gave us excellent recommendations for food and activities.\n\nThis airbnb abode compliments of Kata is just wonderful. From the very beginning of contact all communication was 100% perfection. Although we never met Kata in person as she was in another country everything worked like clockwork because Kata is very dedicated to customer care and satisfaction. Her airbnb site information leaves nothing to chance and as one is with her from start to completion on the site all goes smoothly. We got the shuttle service from the airport (very efficient) which both dropped us at her door and picked us up from there on departure. Accessing the complex and apartment is so easy. Kata's place is so central, just a short walk from Keleti railway station with excellent connections. We were there for the 2016 European La Crosse Championships in Godollo. Her place in light, airy, spacious, spotlessly clean, has a wonderful shower and full self catering facilities if required but eh Budapest is great for eating out. \r\nThe space is very safe and extra quiet. They are no ifs or buts, it is magnificent and at a most wonderful price for a major exciting European capital. Thank you so much Kata for a very positive experience. \n\nI had a wonderful time, the flat itself was beautiful and Kata was an excellent host, very quick to respond and pleasant.\n\nKata was so welcoming that she had food in the fridge that was a total curtesy and was nice to come straight into after a long travel. She checked in on me to make sure everything was operational and was even incredibly understanding after an accident on my part. Excellent host!\n\nWe had an excellent stay at Kata's apartment.  She was very responsive and helpful before our trip, offering some great and unique advice about places to visit on our first visit to Budapest.\n\nThe appartment was easy to find with Kata's instructions and in a good location. It's just a short walk from city park which has one of the main thermal spas.\n\nThe apartment was incredibly clean and well equiped with everything that we needed, including towels and some strawberries in the fridge to enjoy when we arrived! \n\nI would highly recommend Kata's apartment as a place to stay whilst in Budapest - thank you!", "accommodates": "2", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "3PM - 2AM (next day)", "availability": "2 nights minimum stay", "host_reviews": "22", "beds": "1", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/21876745", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": true, "review_summary": "Bright studio apartment, fully equipped bathroom and kitchen, generously spaced living room and gallery with a futon-bed that comfortably fit two.

Located in a historic building that's been recently renovated, with quiet neighbours and lots of sunlight.\n\nYou'll have full use of the apartment and everything you find inside. \n\nThe bathroom is equipped with shower gel, shampoo, soap, laundry detergent, and toilet paper. Fresh linen, towels, hair dryer, iron and ironing board are also provided.\n\nYou'll find tea and coffee in the kitchen, and basic dry ingredients.\n\nI will leave the keys in a key lock for you and send on details of exactly where you'll find it. So don't worry if you don't have a specific arrival time, or it is in the early hours or late at night! You will find the detailed 'house rules' on the kitchen table, with a short description of how everything works in the apartment.\n\nMost of the time I'm abroad for work, but when I'm home, I will be happy to meet and greet you, and tell you about the city and the neighbourhood if you need any insights or tips. When I'm away, my lovely mum kindly looks after my guests for me :)\n\nVery easy to reach all major sights with excellent public transport links, and night buses also stop on the doorstep. \n\nThe apartment is in an old historic building which has recently been renovated, towards the back on the 2nd floor, away from the hustle and bustle of the street. There's no lift in the building, just a lovely big stone staircase. The aristocratic high ceiling and large windows of the apartments ensure it is lovely and bright during the day.\n\nThe windows overlook a school with some activity during the day at the breaks (you may hear them in the summer with windows open), but complete peace and quiet in the evenings and weekends. \n\nThere is free parking nearby on a large square, few minutes walk away if you need it. On street parking is generally safe in the area, there are a few embassies and office buildings around there. Watch out for signs, some streets have free parking but you may need to pay when you turn the corner.\n\nHeroes Square station of the M1 metro line and the Eastern Railway Station (Keleti) with M3 metro line are both about 10-15 mins walk away. 11 lines of buses and trolley buses to and from the city centre stop nearly on the doorstep ((PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)) , with 2 night buses also (907, 973).\n\nTaxis can be a bit overpriced, especially if hailed on the street. If you prefer to get around that way in Budapest, I recommend using the Uber app. Uber cars tend to be clean with reliable drivers, at a reasonable price.\n\nWater pipes run in the kitchen wall shared with the next door neighbour - when they turn on the tap in their kitchen, you can hear that on my side too.

That costs 1\u20ac/h, but the maximum is 3 hours - so you need to personally renew the ticket every 3 hours. We therefore recommend, for weekdays, a nearby parking garage, 300m away at 12\u20ac per day.\nPINBALL\nEach happy home has its own, real & working 80's pinball. Guests can play and enjoy anytime. All we ask for is to handle this little beauty with extreme care. It\u2019s very old and hard to fix when broken - spare parts are hard to find and require international shipping. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the Pinball will work at all times.\nINSTRUMENTS\nhappy home has its own instruments for you! A nylon-string-guitar and a keyboard with good piano-sound. For musicians, this is a true survival kit :) And it's fun for anyone else!\nTRANSFERS\nIf you arrive by airplane, we can arrange transfers for you, both ways, at a very fair price! Why book the transfers with us?\n* no need to wait upon arrival * our driver welcomes you at arrivals with a happy home sign * you get a trustworthy driver with a comfy car * our driver is familiar with happy home * good coordination between transfer and check-in * no extra charge for luggage * for your return transfer, we can pre-arrange pick-up from happy home to to the airport.\nHOUSE RULES\nThis section provides rules for a clear understanding of obligations related to your stay.

As other reviewers have noted it is in a lively area and just meters to pubs and restaurants but is in a secure quiet building so noise is no issue and is safe and easily accessible.  The flat is rustic and unique but with everything one needs.  Tamas made some good suggestions for things to do and was responsive to my questions and concerns.  There isn't much headroom in the upstairs sleeping area, but wasn't a problem or concern for me.  They've done the best they can with the small space and should work very well for a solo traveler or couple.  \n\nMarie and I throughly enjoyed our stay at the apartment. Not only is it in a fabulous location, walking distance to cafes, shops, bars etc..\nBut it's a beautiful place, very clean and our hosts were most accommodating. We felt very welcome, we will stay here next time we visit Budapest! \n\nLocation-excellent, bustling area but very quiet peaceful house. It felt very secure and has a great look. It is in a perfect position for exploring the city, very close to transport links, make sure you use them it is so easy and efficient to do.\n\nEverything was perfect.\r\nMarta was sick at the time I arrived but he managed to find the way to get the key at the right time we scheduled\u2026\n\nCool apartment and a great location. Tamas was very accomodating and super nice. \n\nEverything you need and the best location in the city, what's more important is its beautiful architecture and decoration that make you be willing to live here just like home.\n\nThe location is perfect. The apartment clean, tidy and a lovely rustic feel with all the modern amenities that I needed. I was welcomed with a beer, and met Tamas. Tamas' communication is fantastic, at no point was I left wondering what to do or where to be, he's incredibly friendly and if you get a chance sit and have a coffee with him, awesome dude!\n\nMatyas and Tamas went ABOVE and beyond! I cannot begin to describe their kindness and help. My experience in Budapest was amazing in large part because of them. The flat is beautiful, so clean, and just as it appears in photos. You will have everything you need here. I highly recommend! \n\nMatyas met us right outside of the apartment even though we were a little late and couldn't communicate as well as we'd hoped (the wifi at the Budapest airport is spotty). He was incredibly friendly and made us feel at home. His house is small but lovely - perfect for one or two people. The location is superb! The only thing I would point out is that the sleeping arrangements are a bit cramped (for a tall person) and there's only a mattress in the loft (which the pictures make completely clear). I would still stay again at Matyas's place as he was a great host and the house was wonderful! \n\nM\u00e1ty\u00e1s was so friendly and outgoing, communicated quickly and effectively, and his home went beyond my expectations. The apartment was in a perfect location for going out (especially for food, coffeeshops, transport, and nightlife), but still was quiet and homey.

Beautifully decorated and maintained. Host staff were amazing and always on hand for advice. We had a late afternoon flight home, and Team Oasis organised a free taxi to their offices for us to store our luggage for the afternoon. Smartphone is a great idea! Thank you so, so much. See you next time. \n\nWe loved our stay here . It's so close to everything you don't need to get a bus tour ticket ! Personal touches like the champagne for my wife as it was her birthday and having  the mobile phone to use was really  helpful \n communication was outstanding right down to organising taxis for us \n\nWe will be back 100%  \n\nThis is an exceptional spot - quiet, very well located with all mod cons including very comfortable beds, couch, excellent showers. I honestly could not fault it. Hosts were flawless too.\n\nThis was the nicest AirBnB I have stayed in both from the apartment itself to the little extra that were provided for us.  \r\n\r\nThe details were amazing, nice bathroom products, the pressure of the shower, the comfortableness of the bedsheets, the quietness of the apartment altogether.  A rare gem! Congrats on providing an exceptional experience at a good price.  Well done.\n\nLovely, warm, practical and pretty flat. We enjoyed staying on the quieter side of the river so there was no noise at night and we enjoyed the walk across the bridge. Very helpful host and the mobile phone was a useful addition. Thank you!\n\nWe loved this apartment! Perfect for two couples or two persons because of the two separat bed- and bathrooms. Thanks for having us!\n\nCommunication very easy and quick.\nCheck in and out very smooth \nVery helpful stuff\nThe place it's as in the pictures, spacious, clean and very quite.\n\nGreat location, totally recommend it \n\nStay was amazing. Close to everything, but on the quieter Buda side. Easy access to tram and metro to get where ever you want. Highly recommend this flat!\n\nA great apartment that has been put together in a very thoughtful and stylish way, everything is well done and of lovely quality.  The location, in a very quiet neighbourhood, was perfect for us being within in easy walking distance of the river area, the Chain Bridge and the beautiful Castle/Royal Palace area.  There are a good selection of restaurants/cafes/bars which are again within easy walking distance of the apartment.\r\nOrganisation was great too, and the taxi transfers that were arranged were exactly as requested.  Franz is obviously a host who takes a real pride in his apartment.  All in all a lovely stay.  Thank you :)\n\nFantastic apartment, great location and excellent service / communication from our hosts! Very helpful to offer advice & make arrangements on our behalf (the introduction booklet was very handy, giving you good suggestions on what and where to go).

It was clean and everything needed inside.  \n\nVery nice accommodation for two people, directly in the centre, 10 min from subway. Adrienn was very communicative, responding immediately. If you are looking for a nice place to stay in Budapest, I recommend this one! \n\nThe location of this flat is amazing, right in the center of town. There's plenty of bars and restaurants all around the area, it's in the middle of everything.\r\n\r\nIt's on a private courtyard, so even when it's busy right outside on the street, it's nice and quiet inside. The room can be a little dark, there's only a small window above the door, and the door itself has some frosted glass that lets in light too.\r\n\r\nThe bed (really just a mattress) is up on a loft above the main room, and is pretty comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen is in the main room, and there's plenty of dishes, pots, pans etc. There's an electric double hotplate on the counter for cooking, which is functional but don't expect to cook masterpieces here. Fridge and washer both work as expected (no dryer though).\r\n\r\nThe bathroom is small but everything works, water pressure and heat are both great.\r\n\r\nThere's a small table and two chairs in the main room, great for meals. Unfortunately no couch or armchairs, so lounging isn't really possible except up on the loft bed.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of storage to unpack your things, shelves and a dresser and some hangers and hooks.\n\nAdrienn's place is a great location to be amongst the vibe of the city, while also being able to retreat to a cozy quiet home when it's time to sleep. Her place was perfect for me, and would definitely stay her again. Adrienn was attentive with communication and made sure I was happy throughout the stay. I definitely recommend this place!\n\nThe flat was a bit smaller than we expected,but big enough for 2persons and really nice.It is also pretty close to some of the atractions and if it hadn't been raining most of the time,we wouldn't have used the taxi or the metro.\nIf you tend to be the not-so-quiet type you could consider either being quiet or searching for another place since the walls are pretty thin.We could sometimes hear our neighbours' morning routine and talk,but the place is overall really  quiet.\nWe didn't meet the owner,but she replied quickly to our texts and even allowed us to have an earlier check in.\n\ncozy apartment and great location to enjoy the beautiful city of Budapest.  Nice and helpful host.\n\nFeeling like home \n\nWe loved staying here! The pictures don't do the flat justice; it was more spacious than we thought it would be, especially the bed upstairs which was very comfy. We never met Adrienn but we didnt need to; all communication was fantastic, good instructions to find the flat, wifi was excellent, washing machine was good and drying space was ample. Great value for money too :)\n\nSuper nice and centrally located apartment, perfect for a long weekend. We had a great time in Budapest! \n\nAbsolutely great location and lovely little place. Everything clean and welcoming for our stay. Very hot during the night however so be prepared.\n\nTolle Unterkunft in bester Lage! Adrienn haben wir leider nicht getroffen, aber ihre Beschreibung und Hinweise waren einwandfrei, um alles zu finden. Sie hat uns au\u00dferdem darauf hingewiesen, dass gleich in der N\u00e4he ein Gep\u00e4ckaufbewahrungsservice ist, den wir genutzt haben, da am Tag des Check outs neue G\u00e4ste angereist sind und wir unser Gep\u00e4ck nicht l\u00e4nger in der Wohnung lassen konnten.

We didn't have any problem finding it, the location was perfect. The apartment is very spacious and comfortable, exactly like in the pictures. It is very clean and has all basic stuff a person needs. We enjoyed our staying. Eszter was very easy to communicate with and a nice host. I would certainly recommend this appartment.\n\nEverything was super awesome. THX Eszter. \n\nCommunication were good. From the airport it is about an hour on a bus and the metro.  (I had to take a taxi to the airport to catch my flight. It was 40 euros from the apartment.) It was a little confusing to find the main street coming out of the metro as it is very large but after about 30 minutes of walking I found it. (Note: I recommend taking exit \u201cA\u201d out of the metro and then just walking along Katona Jozsef several blocks until you hit the street. This is much easier than trying to find Szant Istvan.) Eszter met me and showed me to the apartment. Note: where were some drunk me around the building and the street and there is public urination. This is not a reflection on the apartment but just so you know what to expect. A female colleague who lives in the neighborhood said this was just typical and I did see a lot of other drunk men in other parts of the city I visited so it would not deter me from staying here again and I never felt unsafe. There are lots of nice businesses on the street but I think it is just common to have people on the street. The apartment is very clean but without much decoration so it feels little sterile. However, everything works well, good wifi, and the location is good. One reason I booked here was to be able to run on Margaret Island and it will really nice, plus there is a gym where you can workout for about 4 Euro. You are also close to St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica and the Parliament building. There are also lots of small but nice supermarkets in the neighborhood.  I had to work the entire time I was there and could not do much but it is a nice location adn I recommend Eszter and her apartment. \n\nEszter welcomed us on Sunday Evening. She invited us for a nice drink at the restaurant at the street corner \"The Blue Tomato\"  with her husband. We spoke about many subject just as old friends. She had prepared for us coffee, bread, butter and jam in the kitchen for the 3 breakfasts. The building is very nice, with Art Deco Facade and the appartement is warm, clean, and very spacious. Wifi works very well and it's a high speed connection system. The neighborhood is great too, with all the facilities (transport, restaurants, shopping center, historical sites, cinemas). Thanks a lot Ezster and hope to see you again.\r\n\n\nWe stayed in Eszters apartment after the Christmas days through new year 2015/16. The apartment is clean,  with basic equipment, the apartment is located very central, close to Donau, parlament, tram no. 2 and other significant public transportation, in a quiet neighbourhood with local atmosphere, shops and restaurants. We would definitely recommend the apartment and the neighborhood. Eszter are friendly and reliable, and willing to assist in any questions.0\n\nWe had great days in Budapest and in Eszter's flat. It is very tidy and clean. The localization of the flat is perfect. Everything was good, Eszter is a great host, she answers quickly and she is very helpful. Thank you very much. I won't hesitate to come again ! \n\nEszter is a perfect host. The place was clean and tidy. Near the parliament. The couch it's very well. Wifi works perfect and she had no problem helping me with my change of plans. So patience. Budapest its beautiful if I come back of course I'll be in the Quiet Oasis! \n\nShe helps our check in and answers all our questions promptly so we are very comfortable. Apartment is very big and in good location to see all the sightseeing area by foot if you like to walk. Only down side for us (we are there for 6days) is that kitchen facility are aged and missing because we hope to make many dishes(has all the basic stuff) other than that, it's all good and good value for price.\n\nMy friend and I really felt at home in Eszter's flat. It is clean, light and comfortable, just like on the photos. It's close to nearly everywhere in a walking distance, but also busses, tram and metro are nearby. The contact to Eszter was always quick, easy and very friendly.  If in the future I should come back to Budapest, this is my place to stay!\n\nGreat place to stay in BP.

It was very centrally located. The host was flexible with check in times and allowed me to check in early.\n\nClean, cozy and perfectly located. I highly recommend this place. \n\nWe had a very pleasant stay at this place. The appartement was modern and beautiful and it was in a very nice appartement building. It was close to public transport and to the jewish quarter, where all the ruin bars are. We even got picked up at the airport by a friend of Lila for a very good price instead of having to wait for a taxi at night, it was perfect!\n\nEnjoyed a week at Lilla's place in the heart of Budapest. Communication was smooth throughout and she was even able to accommodate an early check in which was much appreciated...! \r\n\r\nThank you to Lilla and her team.\n\nThe building is under construction but the place itself is really nice and well located ! It is a wonderful place that I highly recommend and Lilla is pretty cool, no problem with the communication ! :) \n\nThe apartment looked exactly like the photos and Lilla's colleague Dora was extremely welcoming. Dora gave us some additional tips for great places to see in Budapest as well as the ones on the blackboard.\r\nThe location is ideal for exploring the Jewish quarter. 5mins walk from the best ruin bars but it's on a really quiet residential street so no noise at night.\r\nThis was our first Airbnb and it was an awesome experience. Would definitely recommend Lilla's apartments to others.\n\nOur stay at Lilla's place was perfect, we highly recommend to stay there ! The whole appartment is new, very cosy, with absolutely everything we needed ! It's in the very city center, close from all the main cool places in Budapest ! And Lilla and her friend provided us pretty good advices to enjoy Budapest as the locals do ! Don't hesitate any more, choose Lilla's place :)\n\nDani has received us, he was a very kind host, explaining every of our doubts. The apartment is very tidy, inside a typical Hungary building in the heart of Budapest. The neighborhood is safe and has a good public transport access, very near to the main bars and parties. We had a amazing staying in Budapest!\n\nMy bf and i enjoyed our stay at Lilla's place. The apartment was very clean and beautiful, We had everything we needed.

We have a washing machine so you can clean your clothes if you need to.\n\nAbout the house:\nAs this is a very old historical house, the inner height is above 4 meters, so we created an inner floor for the bedroom. Both inner floors are completely comfortable and standing height (most of the time more then 4m), the stairs are big and wide, so it is absolutely convinient to walk up and down.\nThe house itself is the oldest house in the street, and back then at the end of the 19th century it was a luxory resort built buy the citys major to host himself and his family. The guy was called Szentkiralyi Moric, and the street where the house is located, got named after him. We have a big tree in the middle of garden of the house, which got planted by the granddaughter of Moric more then a hundred years ago.\n\nYou will have your own keys, and noone else can access the apartment.\nYou have your own shower, toilet, kitchen, and everything what you can see on the pictures.\n\nOur policy is to have at least one personal interaction with our guests, so we can make sure that you arrived safe and everything is ok with the apartment.\nOn top of that you can always reach us through phone, sms, email, etc.\n\nIt is fair to say that the apartment is in the center. The main rules about things in Budapest are pretty easy:\n- Most of things are in Pest, Buda is more residential and there are basically two things to check there: the Castle and the Geller Hill. But those are must sees :)\n- Pest is basically divided by half rings. If you look at the map it becomes pretty easy to understand. The big circle called \"Hungaria ring\", and that is more the industrial area. Almost everything what is interesting in Pest is located inside the 2nd ring, which is called the \"Grand Boulevard\", it goes from Margit bridge to Petofi bridge. And then we have the \"Small Boulevard\" which is basically the very center of the city. The apartment is located between the Small and the Grand, closer to the Small Boulevard.\nIt is very close to the \"Party district\" which is the most vibrant part of the city, full of bars, ruin pubs and very nice streetfood places (the party district is basically that part of the VII-th district that is located between the Small and the Grand Boulevard. Our apartment is on the very border of the VII-th and the VIII-th. So you need to walk roughly 400m-s to be in the vibrant place, but yet you can still sleep in a more relaxed area, called the \"Palota District\" which used to be the richest area of the city 150 years ago, so its full of very nice buildings.\nBottom line: the center of Budapest is rather small, everything is in walking distance. You can grab your bag in the morning, have a good coffe, and then just walk around very easily, as you are right there :)\nSome key spots, and the distance of them from our apartment according to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN):\n- Nepliget Bus Station - 35min with Metro line 2 (blue line)\n- National Museum - 300m, 2mins walk\n- The Grand Synagog - 500m, 7mins walk \n- Simpla Kert, the most famous bar in Budapest - 750m, 8mins walk\n- Gozsdu Garden, the best bars in the city - 850m, 10mins walk\n- Deak Square, the very very center and best open space bars - 1000m, 11mins walk\n- The Danube Riverfront - 1500m, 15mins walk\n- The Castle, for this you may want to catch a bus, but still it is much better on foot - 2,9km, 35mins walk\n\nSome usefull places around:\n- Supermarket - we have Spar on the corner of the Szentkiralyi and Rakoczi str, some 200m walking\n- We have a pharmacy on Rakoczi str, next to the Spar some 250m walking\nFinally some recommendations on what to do and where to eat, nearby:\n- Best cheap streetfood - Bors Gastrobar\n- Best bistro restaurant - Fricska\n- Best coctail - Farm Gastrobar\n- Best pub (elected by tripadvisor as best in the WORLD) - Szimpla Kert\n- Best winebar - DiVino in Gozsdu or DiVino next to the Basilica\n- Best coffee - Budapest Baristas\n- Best todo in the morning - Grand marketplace, next to Fovam square\n- Best todo in the afternoon - Climb the Gellert hill and watch the sunset from the Citadell\nThe metro line 3, 4 is just 2 minutes far.\n\nHow to get here?\n0. The address again:\n1088 Budapest, Szentkir\u00e1lyi str. 10. \nIt is in the VIII-th district.\n\n1. From the airport:\nIf you arrive before lets say 11pm, you can come by public transport. \nCatch the 200E bus (the only bus :) from the AP), and get to \"KOKI Terminal\", which is the last station. There you get on the Blue metroline (Line 2), and come to \"Kalvin Ter\" stop. From there we are in walking distance. This will cost you two tickets, so around 2 EUR per person.\nIf you arrive by the night, or you are not on extreme budget, you can come buy taxi, which will cost you around 20-25 EUR. Taxis in the airport and heavily controlled, so you don't have to be affraid of pirates.\n\n2. By Bus:\nMost probably you will arrive to the \"Nepliget Terminal\". There you get on the Blue metroline (Line 2), and come to \"Kalvin Ter\" stop. From there we are in walking distance. This will cost you two tickets, so around 2 EUR per person.\n\n3. By car\nJust type in the address to your GPS, it will get to the right place.\nYou can park on the street easily, but it is a pay zone from 8am to 8pm, and the tariff is the highest class, as we are in the center :( 440 HUF per hour, some 1,3 EUR per hour.\nThere is a guarded parking place next to our house as well, on Brody Sandor str. Here: (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)\"E.\n\n4. By train:\nMost probably you will arrive to \"Keleti station\".\nFrom there you can take plenty of different busses to our apartment:\n(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN). You can buy tickets on the bus or in any kiosk.\nOne trip will cost you 1 EUR.\n\nHow to move around?\n1. Easiest is for sure: by foot! Everything is so close, and you can catch the vibe much better.\n2. You can get a Budapest Card (URL HIDDEN) with free public transport and multiple free entrances included\n3. You can just buy a big bunch of tickets and move around as needed by our superior public transport system, called BKV (URL HIDDEN)\n4. You can rent a bike from our BUBI system (URL HIDDEN)\n\nWho are we and what is the FunHouse group?\nThis is a family owned business, ran by Lilla and Akos (Thats us :) ) a young couple working in the IT industry. We travel a lot, and been to a lot of places around the globe, so we know exactly what a traveled needs. We decided to start our own apartments here in Budapest, and they prooved to be a success :)\nIf you stay in one of the members of the FunHouse group you will always have the same experience driven the following core values:\n- Central location, main attractions in a waling distance, yet not on a busy street to ensure a good night sleep\n- \"Life tested\", which means that we spent several weeks in every apartment as a guest of our own, to fine tune the details, and find out what you would need as a guest\n- Designed by us, we don't believe in mass production living spaces, so all of the apartments are finished and decorated by us, so you will always have the personal touch that makes things a bit unique", "weekly_discount": "7%", "gym": false, "internet": false, "kitchen": true, "lift": false, "suitable_for_events": false, "air_conditioning": false, "name_of_district": "", "hair_dryer": true, "pool": false, "essentials": true, "hangers": true, "wheelchair_accessible": false, "host_description": "", "accuracy_rating": 10, "shampoo": false, "heating": true, "longitude": "19.06422124761743", "extra_people_charge": null, "url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13593878", "pets_allowed": false, "dryer": false, "cleaning_fee": "\u20b4424", "cancellation_type": "Strict", "iron": true, "h24_check_in": true, "cleanliness_review": 10, "photo_urls": ["https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/a7c2dd77-4aa2-40a5-9843-c3d6c114b7dc.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7e552d58-5b7b-46ff-aa4d-becb9145834c.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/983d63fc-e922-4730-ba6b-8cb78d339ab6.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/9340a9c9-d0de-4ed3-b81e-1c0ba8d8b378.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/78a0d35d-8b3c-445a-ae3e-e300d1c0f70a.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d52205d0-7460-4e5f-bc0e-a59e3d2d3646.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/23ce0713-074d-4c1d-8937-bca133e9bbc6.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/53f8f6b2-df55-429a-b24d-e1cea33cd6ce.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1938cc63-1c7e-476c-b962-5f3ec7ffe74a.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/87454c37-a986-4570-b084-eefea395df3a.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d3fc51b1-99e3-4409-aa98-945506f5b2ce.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1a8b7326-6a0a-4dfc-9edc-ba69219825a8.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/fa61d010-e6d5-4b48-89ad-da9ef7b5e361.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/794237d7-d994-4d7a-9321-0af986a8b658.jpg?aki_policy=small"], "smoking_allowed": false, "room_type": "Entire home/apt", "wireless_internet": true},

{"host_name": "Julia", "bathrooms": "1", "check_in_review": 10, "private_entrance": false, "location_review": "Budapest", "laptop_friendly_workspace": true, "reviews_text": "This flat is absolutely nice, clean and comfortable, and the area is very safe. It's excellent location enabled us to reach every important sights within minutes. Julia and Abel were very kind and helpful host. I really recommend it.\n\nNice flat in a perfect area of Budapest. Flat is bigger then what I expected and was very well equipped. There was even some good coffee and good tea, something I love.\r\nThe only drawback, for what Julia can't do anything: the heating is centralized, which means that you can't regulated it on your own. For my taste the heating was too warm and I needed to open the windows regularly to get some cold air inside (central heating is something typical in Budapest). \n\nI would absolutely recommend Julia's place to anyone spending some time in Budapest. It was an easy walk to two different metro stations, and was a great base for exploring the city. You're right on the Danube! My hosts were responsive and attentive and the apartment was great.\n\nGood location and cominication with the host. Julia and Abel were friendly and helping, answering quickly and in detail. Overall possitive experience.\r\n\n\nHighly recomended.\n\nMy stay at Julia's lovely flat has been absolutely amazing. The moment I entered the flat I was so happy. It had everything I needed and more. The flat is cosy, yet spacious, nicely decorated and very clean. The neighbourhood is also perfect. The flat is perfectly located. I was able to walk anywhere I needed; and for those who do not want to walk, then the public transportation is really close as well. I felt really safe in the area even quite late at night.\r\nAbel, who welcomed me inside the house upon my arrival and also who let me out, was very helpful. Communication with him was very easy. Both Julia and Abel were very helpful throughout my stay. So thank you both very much. I recommend the flat to everyone and I would definetely very happily stay there again.  \r\nK\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m!\n\nAlthough I was not able to meet Julia, she was very helpful in providing all information necessary to make my trip one of ease. The apartment is beautiful and in a fantastic location within walking distance of all ideal placed in Budapest city.\n\nThe apartment is a very clean and pleasant one. Its excellent location enabled us to reach every important sights within minutes. Julia is a very kind host and when she is not there, her agent is also very helpful and patient. Always available to help and give information. I would recommend this apartment to everyone.\n\nJulia was an incredible host, even though we did not meet. Her communication was absolutely top shelf, and her emails exuded kindness and thoroughness. Her friend Abel helped me check in and out, and he too was very helpful. They were both understanding about the limitations on my phone and wifi while I was traveling around, which I appreciated! The apartment itself is lovely and comfortable, and in a very nice neighborhood that is central to heading out to many places (try the Hungarikum Bistro just around the corner at the very least!). Everything was in beautiful working order, and ready for a guest. I ended my trip here and felt very happy in the space, re-grouping and resting before heading home.\n\nProbably one of the best flats I ever stayed in - and one of the best AirBnB experiences. Julia was a great, thoughtful, and considerate host. The flat is in a fantastic location, right be the river, just round the corner from the Parliament. All major city attractions are within walking distance - and there is also good access to public transport. We really enjoyed the little coffee shop downstairs - and cake from the raw vegan restaurant round the corner.

Nandor and his mother mad sure that everything was in place. \nHad a great welcome package of drinks, fruits etc.\nLocation was the biggest plus point with some great restaurants located in the street below.\nVery comfortable stay.  \n\nThis is one of the nicest places I've ever stayed. The attention to detail in this flat is amazing. It has everything you could need and if there is something you want all you need to do is ask N\u00e1ndor, he or his mother will take care of it. Great location nice building. Everything you could ask for. Great host and overall perfect experience. THANK YOU!!\n\nThis was an amazing space in the perfect part of Budapest to explore the city.  Great host, made arriving and leaving as easy as possible.  Cannot recommend more highly.  \n\nThe apartment is in a great location, right in the center of the city, close to nice restaurants and it is still very quiet during the week. Nandor's mother helped us with check-in, she was so kind and helpful. The apartment is very clean and there are food and drinks prepared for us. The communication with Nandor also went very well.\r\nWe had a very pleasant stay.\r\n\n\nVery good experience.\nHost was great.  Place was really clean and he was there to great us at check in.  They even stocked the fridge for our arrival with various items.  \n\nDa ich generell ein Mensch bin, der offen bestimmte Thematiken anspricht, m\u00f6chte ich mich auch hier nicht mit meiner Beurteilung zur\u00fcckhalten.\r\nWer nur kurz lesen m\u00f6chte, wie unser Gesamteindruck war: Wir haben uns wie zu Hause gef\u00fchlt.\r\nEmpfangen wurden wir herzlichst schon auf der Stra\u00dfe mit Hinweisen zu Parksituation und Kosten. Wer mit dem Auto anreist, der kann dieses in der Tiefgarage direkt vor der Wohnung parken (Zus\u00e4tzliche Kosten).\r\nNach der Einweisung in der Wohnung hatten wir die M\u00f6glichkeit Fragen zu stellen, die Wifi-Anbindung (Schnelle Daten\u00fcbertragung) wurde uns erkl\u00e4rt und das Hauseigene Alarmsystem. \r\nBereits am Anfang standen Lebensmittel, Kaffee und Champagner bereit, damit am Folgetag keine Hektik zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck entsteht.\r\n\r\nDie Wohnung ist sehr sauber gehalten und dank der Heizung und der Klimaanlage auch recht warm. Wer Fernsehen mag erh\u00e4lt ein Internationales Programm - darunter auch deutsches und britisches Fernsehen.\r\n\r\nGenerell kann vermerkt werden, dass wir zu jeder Zeit einen Ansprechpartner hatten - falls gew\u00fcnscht auch in deutscher Sprache.\r\nN\u00e1ndor selber ist ein kluger und gebildeter junger Mann, mit dem man sich auch Unterhalten kann und der direkt auf W\u00fcnsche und Anregungen eingeht.\r\n\r\nWir f\u00fcr unseren Teil sind begeistert gewesen - \u00dcber die Gastgeber, der Wohnung, die gro\u00dfartige Stadt, dem Essen und der sch\u00f6nen Zeit, die wir vor Ort zu Silvester erleben durften.\r\n\r\nLetzendlich noch einen Tipp zu Taxis: Taxis sind recht g\u00fcnstig - es gibt allerdings auch \"private\" Taxifahrer, die einem gerne das 4-fache des Preises berechnen. \r\nAchtet darauf, dass ihr ein Taxi mit Unternehmung im Hintergrund w\u00e4hlt oder fragt nach einem preis f\u00fcr die Fahrt.\r\n\r\nIch w\u00fcnsche einen sch\u00f6nen Aufenthalt vor Ort.\r\n", "accommodates": "4", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Flexible", "availability": "3 nights minimum stay", "host_reviews": "25", "beds": "2", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/10266446", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": false, "review_summary": "A luxurious, huge and light flat.

A total privilege to be able to stay in such a noble and well presented apartment. Hajnal is the perfect host in every respect. Attentive to detail, faultlessly polite and a joy to meet.\n\nThis is a fantastic apartment in a fantastic location and is a great base for exploring the beautiful city of Budapest.\r\n\r\nHajnal was a great host, was waiting for us on arrival even after a small delay on our flight and provided us some great recommendations on where to go and what to do in Budapest. Subsequent communication was prompt, friendly and very helpful.\r\n\r\nWould not hesitate to stay here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay.\n\nHajnal was very hospitable, was very responsive with my questions and met me outside to greet me. The apartment was fabulous! It had such a great charm to it. She had everything there I could possibly want and more. The tall ceilings and double doors inside the apartment made me feel a bit like a princess. Almost daily I used the record player she had there with a great selection of classics! The balcony was fun too but the weather was too cold to really enjoy it. She gave me a great tip on a local farmers market that was a highlight to my stay. The location is off a quieter side street, but was a close enough distance from the center that I walked there and back every day, sometimes multiple times. Next door (on either side) was an Indian restaurant and a coffee shop...both good! I've already recommended this place to a few friends and would love to come back myself the next time I'm in the area!\n\nHajnal was a great host and responded beyond our needs. She went out her way to make sure we had everything we needed for our baby which was much appriciated. The apartment is beautiful and spacious but still has a really cosy feeling. Really nice record collection as well. Would highly recommend.\n\nHajnal's place is perfect, like a home away from home, great location, if your looking for a place in Budapest, this is definitely it.\n Will totally be looking to rebook when back in Budapest.\n\nEverything was fine for us. The apartment was amazing and situation just perfect. Hajnal was very caring and lovely host.\n\nHajnal is a wonderful person! The apartment is beautiful. I really really recommend this apartment, it is so close to the downtown, is bigger and also you find everything you want outside de building. If you need something, Hajnal is always available.  \n\nWe had a lovely time in the apartment. It was a great space, very attractive and had everything we needed. The location was good and our hostess very helpful. We loved our stay and the city. \n\nHajnal was very helpful during the booking process very quick to respond and answered all our questions. She was there to greet us into her beautiful apartment which is both spacious and very clean. Hajnal had kindly provided tea,coffee wine ,water and nice chocolate biscuits. There were additional toiletries also. The apartment is nicely located to reach all parts of the city and we found it easy to navigate our way around. Budapest was fun we wish Hajnal and family all the best in future and thanks for allowing us to use your lovely place. Cheers MIke & Elaine \n\nWe received emails ahead of time from Hajnal looking forward to our visit and asking about the time & method of our arrival as well as if there as anything she could do or provide for us for our arrival.  The amenities in the apartment were excellent as well as little extras like fruit, coffee, cream, sugar, spices, beer.\r\nHajnal was very available for questions and we feel we have made good friends with her and her family!", "accommodates": "3", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 2PM", "availability": "3 nights minimum stay", "host_reviews": "35", "beds": "2", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/71964851", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": true, "review_summary": "High-ceilinged apartment (60m2), with large private balcony, in the heart of Budapest's Palace District.

The River Danube is a short walk away.\n\nThe apartment is in one of the palaces that give Budapest's 'Palace District' its name. The building, built in 1898 as the city residence of a Transylvanian aristocrat, has kept its charm. \n\nThe apartment is on the first floor, and has the building's main balcony over-looking the street.\n\nI live with my family two streets away from this apartment, so we're nearby to help out with any problems, last-minute requests, and so on.\n\nBudapest's Palace District is a hidden treasure. In the 1800s, aristocrats, and rich citizens built their palaces here, and you can still see them today. This was also the site of the original Hungarian parliament building, which you can still see in our street \u2013 Brody Sandor utca.\n\nToday, it's an up-and-coming area once again. You can still see the elegant old buildings, but now there is a new, arty, Bohemian culture here. There are many unique shops, galleries, restaurants and caf\u00e9s, along with a vibrant student presence.\n\nThere are four metro stations nearby, and major tram lines, so getting around Budapest is easy. The nearest metro is just two minutes away and you're just a quick walk from the centre and the River Danube.\nParking is available on the street, which is free on weekends, or 440 HUF / hour on weekdays.\n\nIf you're arriving from Vienna or Prague by train, get off at Kelenfold train station, and take the metro to Rakoczi Ter metro (10 minutes). From there, it's a 2 minute walk to the apartment. \n\nFrom the airport, there are three options:\n\u2022 Public transport (about \u20ac5 per person, one way). Take Bus 200 from the airport to Kobanya Metro stop. Then take the metro to  Kalvin Ter. Then, it's a 10 minute walk to our apartment. This is the cheapest option, but takes over an hour and is not recommended if you have heavy bags. It's not useful after 23:00, because the metro closes down.\n\u2022 Shuttle bus (about \u20ac10 euro per person, one way). Follow the signs in the airport to the 'miniBUD' airport shuttle desk. This takes about 60 minutes. It will drop you off outside our apartment. You will need to give our address (Brody Sandor utca, 19. VIII District).\n\u2022 Taxi (about \u20ac25, one way).

It didn't take me that much to feel it was also my place. It's a cozy flat, well located, easy to get public transport and I always felt safe walking in the neighborhood. I had all the services and a really good company, D\u00e1niel is super nice and kind. I feel really happy I found this place and D\u00e1niel. \n\nLike others reviews, Daniel is a super friendly host. You may feel like your home during the stay. I met other couples stayed at the other room. And even the other guests were very kind too. Daniel's vibe seems to influence everyone stay at this house. We all shared our food(if u want, of course) and had dinner, beer together.  It was a really great experience to me. I highly recommend his place :)\n\nDaniel is a very friendly and helpful host. His appartment is very close to the Parliament Building at to Margitsziget (Margaret Island), has good tram and bus links, and is just a bit of a walk from the Nyugati station (which lies on Metro Line 3). I recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Budapest !\n\nDaniel is a very friendly host and basically a nice guy. He is very flexible about arrival and departure, done everything he could even though my arrival plans changed in last moment. The apartment is very old but clean. The room is very small but enough, I worked on my laptop in the kitchen. The location is great, very close to bus, trams and even M3 metro line. Neighbourhood is quiet and there are some places with good food and great beer (Mosselen!) close by.\n\nNice place in the center of Budapest to stay. \r\nUnfortunately I didn\u00b4t meet D\u00e1niel, but everything was well-organised and clean.\r\nI will come back :)\n\nDaniel was very responsive to all possible inquiries. He's very sympathetic person. The room I spent 8 day in is cozy. For a person who is just settling  down in Budapest is just great. The location is very convenient in terms of logistics and entertainment. \r\n\r\nDon't think twice :) \n\nRoom was perfect for my requirements. Only main issue was that it is far from the wifi router, so internet is not always working in the room. Daniel was a nice host and the other guests made for a nice atmosphere.\n\nDaniel is just.. just great!

We have a washing machine so you can clean your clothes if you need to.\n\nAbout the house:\nAs this is a very old historical house, the inner height is above 4 meters, so we created an inner floor for the bedroom. Both inner floors are completely comfortable and standing height (most of the time more then 4m), the stairs are big and wide, so it is absolutely convinient to walk up and down.\nThe house itself is the oldest house in the street, and back then at the end of the 19th century it was a luxory resort built buy the citys major to host himself and his family. The guy was called Szentkiralyi Moric, and the street where the house is located, got named after him. We have a big tree in the middle of garden of the house, which got planted by the granddaughter of Moric more then a hundred years ago.\n\nYou will have your own keys, and noone else can access the apartment.\nYou have your own shower, toilet, kitchen, and everything what you can see on the pictures.\n\nOur policy is to have at least one personal interaction with our guests, so we can make sure that you arrived safe and everything is ok with the apartment.\nOn top of that you can always reach us through phone, sms, email, etc.\n\nIt is fair to say that the apartment is in the center. The main rules about things in Budapest are pretty easy:\n- Most of things are in Pest, Buda is more residential and there are basically two things to check there: the Castle and the Geller Hill. But those are must sees :)\n- Pest is basically divided by half rings. If you look at the map it becomes pretty easy to understand. The big circle called \"Hungaria ring\", and that is more the industrial area. Almost everything what is interesting in Pest is located inside the 2nd ring, which is called the \"Grand Boulevard\", it goes from Margit bridge to Petofi bridge. And then we have the \"Small Boulevard\" which is basically the very center of the city. The apartment is located between the Small and the Grand, closer to the Small Boulevard.\nIt is very close to the \"Party district\" which is the most vibrant part of the city, full of bars, ruin pubs and very nice streetfood places (the party district is basically that part of the VII-th district that is located between the Small and the Grand Boulevard. Our apartment is on the very border of the VII-th and the VIII-th. So you need to walk roughly 400m-s to be in the vibrant place, but yet you can still sleep in a more relaxed area, called the \"Palota District\" which used to be the richest area of the city 150 years ago, so its full of very nice buildings.\nBottom line: the center of Budapest is rather small, everything is in walking distance. You can grab your bag in the morning, have a good coffe, and then just walk around very easily, as you are right there :)\nSome key spots, and the distance of them from our apartment according to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN):\n- Nepliget Bus Station - 35min with Metro line 2 (blue line)\n- National Museum - 300m, 2mins walk\n- The Grand Synagog - 500m, 7mins walk \n- Simpla Kert, the most famous bar in Budapest - 750m, 8mins walk\n- Gozsdu Garden, the best bars in the city - 850m, 10mins walk\n- Deak Square, the very very center and best open space bars - 1000m, 11mins walk\n- The Danube Riverfront - 1500m, 15mins walk\n- The Castle, for this you may want to catch a bus, but still it is much better on foot - 2,9km, 35mins walk\n\nSome usefull places around:\n- Supermarket - we have Spar on the corner of the Szentkiralyi and Rakoczi str, some 200m walking\n- We have a pharmacy on Rakoczi str, next to the Spar some 250m walking\nFinally some recommendations on what to do and where to eat, nearby:\n- Best cheap streetfood - Bors Gastrobar\n- Best bistro restaurant - Fricska\n- Best coctail - Farm Gastrobar\n- Best pub (elected by tripadvisor as best in the WORLD) - Szimpla Kert\n- Best winebar - DiVino in Gozsdu or DiVino next to the Basilica\n- Best coffee - Budapest Baristas\n- Best todo in the morning - Grand marketplace, next to Fovam square\n- Best todo in the afternoon - Climb the Gellert hill and watch the sunset from the Citadell\nThe metro line 3, 4 is just 2 minutes far.\n\nHow to get here?\n0. The address again:\n1088 Budapest, Szentkir\u00e1lyi str. 10. \nIt is in the VIII-th district.\n\n1. From the airport:\nIf you arrive before lets say 11pm, you can come by public transport. \nCatch the 200E bus (the only bus :) from the AP), and get to \"KOKI Terminal\", which is the last station. There you get on the Blue metroline (Line 2), and come to \"Kalvin Ter\" stop. From there we are in walking distance. This will cost you two tickets, so around 2 EUR per person.\nIf you arrive by the night, or you are not on extreme budget, you can come buy taxi, which will cost you around 20-25 EUR. Taxis in the airport and heavily controlled, so you don't have to be affraid of pirates.\n\n2. By Bus:\nMost probably you will arrive to the \"Nepliget Terminal\". There you get on the Blue metroline (Line 2), and come to \"Kalvin Ter\" stop. From there we are in walking distance. This will cost you two tickets, so around 2 EUR per person.\n\n3. By car\nJust type in the address to your GPS, it will get to the right place.\nYou can park on the street easily, but it is a pay zone from 8am to 8pm, and the tariff is the highest class, as we are in the center :( 440 HUF per hour, some 1,3 EUR per hour.\nThere is a guarded parking place next to our house as well, on Brody Sandor str. Here: (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)\"E.\n\n4. By train:\nMost probably you will arrive to \"Keleti station\".\nFrom there you can take plenty of different busses to our apartment:\n(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN). You can buy tickets on the bus or in any kiosk.\nOne trip will cost you 1 EUR.\n\nHow to move around?\n1. Easiest is for sure: by foot! Everything is so close, and you can catch the vibe much better.\n2. You can get a Budapest Card (URL HIDDEN) with free public transport and multiple free entrances included\n3. You can just buy a big bunch of tickets and move around as needed by our superior public transport system, called BKV (URL HIDDEN)\n4. You can rent a bike from our BUBI system (URL HIDDEN)\n\nWho are we and what is the FunHouse group?\nThis is a family owned business, ran by Lilla and Akos (Thats us :) ) a young couple working in the IT industry. We travel a lot, and been to a lot of places around the globe, so we know exactly what a traveled needs. We decided to start our own apartments here in Budapest, and they prooved to be a success :)\nIf you stay in one of the members of the FunHouse group you will always have the same experience driven the following core values:\n- Central location, main attractions in a waling distance, yet not on a busy street to ensure a good night sleep\n- \"Life tested\", which means that we spent several weeks in every apartment as a guest of our own, to fine tune the details, and find out what you would need as a guest\n- Designed by us, we don't believe in mass production living spaces, so all of the apartments are finished and decorated by us, so you will always have the personal touch that makes things a bit unique", "weekly_discount": "7%", "gym": false, "internet": false, "kitchen": true, "lift": false, "suitable_for_events": false, "air_conditioning": false, "name_of_district": "", "hair_dryer": true, "pool": false, "essentials": true, "hangers": true, "wheelchair_accessible": false, "host_description": "", "accuracy_rating": 10, "shampoo": false, "heating": true, "longitude": "19.06604296608046", "extra_people_charge": "\u20b4226 / night after 2 guests", "url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13671340", "pets_allowed": false, "dryer": false, "cleaning_fee": "\u20b4424", "cancellation_type": "Strict", "iron": true, "h24_check_in": true, "cleanliness_review": 10, "photo_urls": ["https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b0d48a1c-0f4a-4aeb-9aae-d47de28be065.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/23f8b0fd-80da-46ef-a7ed-2dde6f7f119a.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/e4bcc58e-b47c-4103-b138-05e37258212b.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/afe5d92e-471c-41f2-b7c3-4a074802e341.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/69b2501d-6d85-479f-bd3e-d2745caec48a.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/07c78c62-f2c5-4cd3-8724-347c78804829.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c720ae1a-1a27-4a53-a90f-5cd0c0b879eb.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b894ecf7-7304-4c89-bb63-9f1e4ebf04e0.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/ffa787b2-50a1-4d9b-8686-53de5086af76.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/13c86b53-9284-4189-bd50-6eeead6ccd43.jpg?aki_policy=small", "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/377c778e-c995-4f13-a2fc-ca21bf0d0988.jpg?aki_policy=small"], "smoking_allowed": false, "room_type": "Entire home/apt", "wireless_internet": true},

Overall I will recommend this hostel.\n\nThis place probably has the best value for money in Budapest, especially because it's close to a major station. The host was great and helpful, and overall it was a great experience. \n\nNice little hostel. Ideal place to meet students from all over the world, cook together, have interesting conversations etc., all in a private atmosphere. \r\nFive minutes from Keleti Trainstation and Metro. This place is ideal for a quick stop over to see Budapest main attraction. Tiny little place, nice and safe. Had a great time. Thumbs up!\n\nThe host is excellent, he responds fast to my request online and shows me the most famous places to visit when I arrive there. I enjoy my stay there because of its quietness and tranquility, to me very beneficial after spending time in the center area. \r\n\r\nThe guests are polite and respectful to each other, and I also got to know some interesting person there. \r\n\r\nIt's situated in the eastern part of the city centre, takes about 20 minutes walk to the center, about 30 minutes walk to Buda castle, and it's on the main street so I feel totally safe walking even in the dead of the night.\r\n\r\nOverall, my experience with everything when I stayed there is wonderful and I would recommend it for everyone to visit Budapest if you want to find some place to rest well during your stay there. \n\nThere is hardly any privacy obviously since it's a dormitory! Good stay but i would not recommend to people who is looking for a long stay since many people are going in and out, and I was relocated several times, moving all around the hostel, from room to room due to lack of beds, etc, which was very frustrating. :( Overall, the host was kind and nice, and i would like to recommend for a short stay!\n\nThis place is a good choice if you want to rest and not be bothered by rowdy travelers.\n\nA very nice cosy hostel, would definitely recommend. Room was exactly as described, it was fairly spacious, it didn't feel cramped or anything like that, there was space to put my luggage/ things. The toilettes/washrooms were fine, water was nice and hot and the shower had a good pressure. There was a kitchen you could use to prepare food + tables to sit at and eat your food. The hosts/staff were very kind + helpful.\r\n\r\nThe location was great, literally opposite the main train station which was so so helpful. Also really close the city centre / main party district, it was only a 10 minute walk if that!\r\n\r\nThe hostel is quite small and cosy though, it's doesn't hold that many guests, and therefore doesn't have a bar/large sociable area where you can sit and chat of an evening and meet follower travellers. If you're looking for somewhere nice and quiet where you can rest then this is the hostel for you! Though if you're travelling by yourself for example, and want to stay in a social hostel where you can easily meet lots of new people, this may not be the best place to stay. Though other than that, it's a fantastic hostel, would definitely recommend!\n\nYou guys should know that this place offers very reasonable price in Budapest. I mean, the place is not neat and super comfortable place, however, it is worth being a bit uncomfortable because of super cheap price. If you are looking for just sleeping and taking a shower and going out to the city, this place is the one of the best ones.\n\nThe host was really friendly and helpful. The price is very good.

They allowed us an early check in and they did everything to make us feel welcome. The appartment was slightly smaller than we thought but it was enough for us. To reach the bed, which was a mattress on the floor, you had to climb a staircase that we thought was rather uncomfortable. No handrail and very steep so we went up and down on hands and feet. Not suitable for elderly people but we managed and could laugh about it. We were pleasantly surprised to find the appartment had been cleaned again halfway through our stay with clean towels and a dishcloth. Metro and essential shops are literally around the corner wich Daniel was kind enough to point out to us.\n\nTheir apartment is wonderful, you can find everything you need and the apartment is clean and quiet. David waited for us before house and showed us our \"new temporary address\". He also told something about transport and city and he recommended some places of interest. He was very kind. If we return to Budapest one day, we will ask them for the accommodation.\n\nAbsolutely agree with previous guests. Nothing to complain. And I didn't notice that it was very noisy. Recommended!\n\nThe apartment was perfect for me and my sister! \nDavid was very helpful and met us outside the metro stop - he rang and was in contact with us once we had landed and gave us great tips for exploring the city. \nThe apartment is very modern and well equipped (hair dryer, tea/coffee, towels, microwave, fridge) which made our stay more relaxing. \nThe metro is literally across the road however we walked everywhere in order to see all the sights. \nThe stairs are slightly narrow and a bit tricky to get up and down to the bed but just be extra careful and you'll be fine!! \nThoroughly enjoyed our stay in Budapest, thank you!! \n\nIt was a very nice place and it was clean. The bed was comfortable and it was a nice place to relax. Would definitely recommend. \n\nWe had a great time in Budapest and enjoyed the apartment very much, it's close to the subway and center city too, clean, new, tiny but nice - with two people enough place for a comfi stay. Brigitta and David were good hosts, friendly and available for any question. We definitely can recommend to stay with this apartment!\n\nBrigitta was helpful in organizing a cab ride for us from the airport which made arriving at her place very easy. The apartment is clean and looks exactly like the pictures. Very good for the price. Not right in the city center, but ~10-15 minutes by car. David provided some recommendations for things to do and marked up a map so we could use it over our visit. \n\nWe had a wonderful time on Brigitta's place! Very clean, organized and silent. Very close to the metro station... less then 1 minute walking!!! In front of the appartment. there is a Tesco market and a bakery! David received us and gave us all the information we needed: places to go  (and places to avoid), public transport, restaurants, bakery, markets, thermal baths, everything!!! On our last day, he rented a taxi to take us to the airport! 100% recommended!\n\nThis apartment looks exactly how it is listed. However, I did have a few issues. The location of the apartment is not the most desirable as it is a poor area. The apartment is also one apartment split into several smaller apartments. This means that the walls are very thin and everything is clear to hear between the walls. On the plus side it is only a 2 minute walk to the metro station, which can be used to get into the city centre and it is a good base for a short term stay. Our host Davide was extremely nice and gave us great recommendations for places to eat and how to travel around.\n\nReally great apartment! \r\nEverything exactly as at photos. It's very clean and stylish, a bit small, but well organized and furnished. There is everything you may need. \r\nLocation is perfect: less than 1 min from subway station, bus and tram stops near the house, the city center within walking distance. \r\nHost David is super positive and energetic! He gave us all the information we needed.\r\nNext time will stay only here!", "accommodates": "2", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 2PM", "availability": "2 nights minimum stay", "host_reviews": "156", "beds": "2", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/57744601", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": false, "review_summary": "Our accommodation has four separated, modern and private fully equipped really comfortable apartments.

It's a clean quiet building - and the apartment is spacious and bright. There's a lovely kitchen (which we didn't use) and a clean shower room. The bed and the sofa were comfortable and the place was warm - so we didn't need extra blankets. The wifi was excellent and it had everything we needed.  \n\nGreat location. Almost can reach all the sightseeing in walkable distance. It also close to metro and bus station (but don't really need it, except from airport). There is not many seasoning, so better to eat outside, especially the Hungarian food is so delicious. We have our breakfast at the cafe at street corner near metro station, was big portion and taste good! \n\nBetter to bring your shampoo & conditioner if you needed. There have only shower gels in bathroom. Check in by ourselves with no trouble. \n\nChristmas market is opened now, great atmosphere started few steps outside of downstairs. My experience, the food in the market is more expensive than in local restaurant. \n\nOverall good experience, Budapest is so beautiful. We would like to come here again.\n\nWe loved this apartment, it was very central so just a short walk away from nice restaurants and bars. It was well equipped with everything we'd need and surprisingly quiet considering the great location.

Her place is big and cosy, and it's close to the city center.\n\nThis apartment was lovely. It's in a perfect location, you can walk easily to all major attractions. Fekete had the place set up and organised for us and the directions and instructions were very clear. Fekete was easily contactable for any concerns we had.

My wife and I travelled to Budapest for the first time with our friend. We were in communication with Zita before our arrival and helped us with the location. She met us at the door to the flat and was most welcoming! The location is perfect! A short walk to anything worthwile! Excellent neighborhood for shops, cafe's, and the touristic sites. The flat was clean, spacious, and just an overall great stay. Would stay here again without any hesitation!\n\nThis was a great stay with a very informative and helpful host. Would recommend to all visitors.\n\nWe can't say enough about our stay at Budflat Asgard. We met with Sofie at check-in (Zita was away), and she warmly welcomed us and showed us around the flat. Zita and Sofie ensured that we had all the extras for our 14-month-old daughter. The flat itself is nicely maintained, spacious and with many amenities to make the stay comfortable. The location is excellent - in walking distance to main attractions and close to numerous restaurants, shops and grocery store. We really enjoyed the whole experience and would recommend the flat to anyone. Thanks Sofie and Zita!\n\nZita's flat was exactly as described. We appreciated the character of the apartment, the many thoughtful amenities that were included and how clean the unit was. We also very much enjoyed the central location, fast wifi and close proximity to many good restaurants and sights in the area. Don't hesitate to book with Zita if you are traveling to this beautiful city!\n\nCouldn't have been better! The apartment is very clean and in a great location in the center of Budapest. This place is exactly as it is described. Zita was super nice and very helpful. We got fruits, candy, bottle of wine\r\nand a lot of very useful information about Budapest. key transfer process went smoothly without any problem.\r\n  I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it 100%.\r\n\n\nAlthough we were a late arrival, zita's friend (Sofie) was there for us. She showed us around, had some nice chilled grape juice, and kept in account we might be tired after our journey.\n\nSofie made herself available if there would be anything we needed through iMessage.\n\nThe neighbourhood is also perfect. This is where the better restaurants are, away from the tourist trap areas. It's safe and close by the major sights.\n\nWe can only recommend everybody to stay here :)\n\nBeautiful, clean and spacious apartment in an ideal location. The apartment is bigger than the perception you get when look at the pictures. Lots of great coffee places, restaurants , metro and trams within 10 mins walking distance. A few tourist spots are within 10 mins walking as well. Zita welcomed us on our arrival and showed us the place and answered all questions that we had. In spite of the proximity to all the places, the apartment is in a large building with a huge courtyard in the middle and is very quiet. The Italian restaurant next door was quite good as well. Would definitely stay if I'm back again in Budapest. Highly recommended!\n\nVery nice apartment, super clean and comfortable! Location is amazing especially for tourists. It's very close to a lot of nice bars, restaurants and tourist sites!\n\nbeautiful flat with perfect location. best apartments I have ever rent with very delicate landlord.\nvery spacious and aesthetic flat, excellent choice for 2+1 or 2+2 companies or for family with children. separated shower and WC (for me it s important, especially if you're not just with your partner).

The design of the house is fantastic, thank you.\n\nWe had an amazing time in Claudia's flat. The location couldn't be better.  The flat was very clean, good size, central, and very very comfortable! We didn't meet Claudia but she always responded to our questions and requests immediately. We would love to come back to Budapest and stay in this flat again. Thank you Claudia for being such a great host.\n\nUNBELIEVABLE apartment!!! \nThe BEST location in Budapest. Walking distance from most sites, and very close by to tram and metro. \nThis was our 4th Airbnb apartment and by far the best one (and we've stayed in beautiful apartments). \nThe pictures dose not show how incredibly large and spacious this apartment is. Wherever you look you will find beautiful art pieces, all with great taste, to give you a feeling of home away from home. \nThe Mini Mouse room is awesome! The kids enjoyed sleeping there, and in general really loved exploring the flat. \nWe didn't had the chance to meet Claudia, but was welcomed by a nice girl.  Claudia  was available online  trough the whole time, and helped with great tips. She even booked a taxi to the airport. \nWe defiantly recommend this apartment, and hope to come back one day.  \n\nThis was our return stay. We were looking forward to getting back to Budapest and the apartment. It did not disappoint on our return.\r\nAgain neatly presented, clean - could have had a bit more washing powder for guests convenience - previous people had used it all up. A bar of soap in the bathroom would be great, too.\r\n\r\nThis apartment is suitable for couples or a couple with children. The second double bed is just the children's double bunk/ cubby pictured in images, and would not suffice for adults. \r\n\r\nAll said a great place, with pleasant hosts and a convenient location, almost directly opposite the Opera House and a few steps from the metro. \r\n\r\nThe gentle shudder of the metro is felt in the walls/ building, but I suspect, this would be the case anywhere along the metro line. You do not hear street noise despite being on busy Andrassy Avenue. Double glazing ensures quiet living in a great central location. \r\n\r\nLots of great places to eat around, including Bistro Fine & Ket Szerencen (just around the corner) plus 360 Bar - a stunning Rooftop bar with amazing views is just a short stroll at 39 Andrassy Utca.\r\n\r\nMy remarks are all very minor comments to what is a great place to stay in Budapest. \r\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.\r\n\r\nHost insisted on 10am checkout, but allowed storage of our bags til 1pm, which was perfect!\r\n\r\nThank you Szab and Claudia - this is a great place to stay \n\nListing details accurate. Lovely, bright and spacious in a good central location. Could not fault it. Fanny who checked us in was very kind and showed flexibility to accommodate our return timings and departure requests. Claudia communicated efficiently with us & and addressed our queries. We found the apartment very comfortable and in a great location, with a little coffee house next door where we ate breakfast, got coffees, etc. Located directly opposite the Opera House, so easy access via metro to the city centre and all key tourist locations.\n\nStunning, massive apartment -- your jaw will drop upon entering it.\r\n\r\nGreat, helpful hosts. I arrived late, but someone was there to meet me with a key and introduce me to the apartment. Claudia was available by email for any questions I had.\r\n\r\nThe best Airbnb experience I've ever had.\n\nQuite consistent with description.\r\nGreat location. Very quiet although in a busy street. \r\nClean, well arranged with all the equipment necessary.\r\nSupplies to cook without go shopping on arrival.\r\nCordial welcome, care and attention during our stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n\nThis was a very good experience. Host communication and organisation was first class. The flat itself was very good indeed. It's hard not to get into hyperbole about it, but it's probably the best Airbnb place we've ever stayed in.\r\nIt's situated in one of the best streets in Budapest , with plenty of good bars and restaurants. Transport links are great too, with an underground station 2 minutes walk from the flat.\r\nHost left us a bottle of wine and a few essentials to set us off.\r\nThe flat is beautifully finished and furnished , clean , modern and stylish. Very comfortable. Bathroom furnishings and kitchen are superb.\r\n\r\nIt's on a busy street, so there's plenty to see and do , but when inside the flat you wouldn't realise it. It's very well noise insulated and almost totally silent.  \r\n\r\nWe'd definitely recommend this flat to anyone thinking of visiting Budapest !\n\nThe best of the best... What else to say then that it is perfect and Hosts are also unbelievable... Everything was just perfect!\n\nThe flat was better than the pictures.  The pictures do not give you a sense of scale.  Claudia and Szab's space is massive, and tastefully decorated.  The finishes feel high end, and don't only look good for the photos.  Internet connection was fast enough, stable, and a high-powered router meant a strong signal throughout the property.  The space is in an upmarket building with offices and is very quiet.  Good sound insolation means you will not be disturbed, despite being on a main street.  The location is excellent, with a metro stop around the corner, and a supermarket across the street.  Szab and Claudia were readily available and very attentive. The flat is well appointed, with everything you need.  All you need to bring is a toothbrush.

Location is very good, 5 min far from metro, 10 min far from Szechyni bath house and 20 min to city center!! The host was very quick in response, sensitive and very responsible!! Highly recommend!! \n\nThe area of the apartment is very good, very close to Keleti, and as me & my friend arrived and left via the rail station it was perfect for us. The host was very friendly and welcome, providing us with communication and all the possible help during the entire stay. The apartment itself was very cozy and clean. A wonderful Budapest experience.\n\nIt was beautiful little flat in the heart of Erzhebetvarosh district. I'm fond of appartment's design - it's fantastic! All for your comfort jorney is here: towels, soap, iron, coffe machine, frizzer, dish washer... We were first who opened an iron :) It's no far from Secheny baths (around 20 munites by foot). You can take the city centre by foot around 1 hour. The bus stop is close to the flat. \r\n\r\nZsuzsanna and her dougther are good persons! Thank you for hospitality and  help! :)\n\nGood location\nNice appartment", "accommodates": "4", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Apartment", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 2PM", "availability": "2 nights minimum stay", "host_reviews": "16", "beds": "2", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/80755759", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": false, "review_summary": "A totally renewed charming 28 sqm appartement in an old retro style house is available to 2 or 2+2 persons.

Niki was very nice and she welcomed us with a letter - by the way GREAT Wifi Name :p the flat is near the Center of the City - You can reach everything with the Bus or the Tram. Thank You for Hosting us :-) we are definitly coming back to Budapest - its a really Great City and Maybe we Finally meet when we are coming back. Thanks for everything!\nxx\nTamara and Sabrina from Austria. \n\nGreat apartment. Cute and spacious enough for two without feeling on top of each other at all. Niki very sweetly left is some bread, fruit and water. \n\nThe location was a bit far out from the city compared to some other places but transport links were so good (and we wanted to do a lot of walking ) that it wasn't an issue and I'd say shouldn't deter anyone from the apartment. \n\nNiki was great with responding to any queries before we arrived and processes for  checking in and out as our timings were very early or late were so easy and quick. \n\nGreat clean apartment. Only thing, and tiny in the scheme of things, is that the shower head didn't fit in the bracket holder and so had to hold it when showering \n\nOverall an amazing and sweet apartment that is brilliant value. And would definitely stay again. \n\nThe expirience in the Niki\u00b4s apartment was absolutely amazing! \r\nThe studio is exactly the same as shown in the photos. It was also quite esay to get to. Unfortunaly, I didn\u00b4t get to know Niki in person but I am very thankful and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this studio for your stay. \r\n\r\n\n\nGreat communication, all questions were answered quickly. Apartment was easy to find and the photos showed it clearly. Not in the area we were expecting however this is down to our own lack of research and was a short taxi ride. Overall a very cute apartment, thanks for the lovely stay!\n\nNiki was a lovely and helpful host. The flat was well located, it was easy to get into town and it had everything we needed. I would however say that the flat looks bigger and more comfortable in the photos that it did in real life. \n\nThe host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n\nwe spend 5 nights at Niki's flat. everything was good. it's near to public transport (tram and buses) and city center (deak square). we didnt meet Niki, but she was helpful and reactive. the flat is nice (like on pictures). checkin and checkout was pretty easy, we left keys on letterbox. I recommand. thank you Niki :)\n\nNice flat, very sweet and confortable as on pictures ! Very good location, calm and near the public transport. Niki is helpful and reactive :)\r\nIn short, we recommend !\r\n\n\nAbsolutely love Niki's place! Although we didn't get to meet Niki she was extremely helpful and quick to reply to all our questions. Great location with public transport close by that will take you to all the amazing places Budapest has to offer. The apartment was a home away from home with everything we needed! Didn't want to leave :)\n\nThe room was nice and we were even given fruit and wine on arrival. Excellent communication was really helpful with any issues too.

She is friendly, patient and willing to spend some time to give us more information about the city. The apartment is beautiful, spacious and clean. We had a great stay in Budapest and we really love the city. \nJust 5mins walk to Chain Bridge. \nLess than 10mins walk to Parliament/St Stephen. \nOpposite bus stop to Buda Castle Hill / Fisherman's Baption. \nJust around the corner: Main course, Coffee & Dessert at Gerbeaud Cafe Anno 1858 is excellent, reasonable price. Must try!\n\nPerfect location for exploring Budapest. The Christmas markets were only a 2 minute walk away and the town centre on the other side of that. Lots of bars with cheap drinks close by. The underground station was only 400m away and an easy ride to the thermal baths and the airport. Would definitely stay in this lovely apartment again! \n\nHajnalka and her place are lovely. It gives you a little glimpse into the apartments of the locals. Hajnalka (sunrise in Hungarian) was a gracious host and helped us with restaurant suggestions and getting a taxi on the last day. She was afraid her English was not good enough (it is) and was able to communicate more accurately with the help of her son on the telephone. There is a modern digital elevator in the building, which was a nice surprise. The apartment is clean and bright. The view out of the giant windows is of the lovely Chain Bridge and the St. Mathias church across the river. Lovely wood floors, comfortable bed with nice pillows. Had some friends staying next door at the Sofitel and they were JEALOUS of us and our accommodations. Christmas market was right around the corner as was the underground. We took a short trip to Szentendre on the train. Great trip. Thank you Hajnalka for a lovely visit.\n\nAt first I want to express our satisfaction not only for the apartment but also for ms Hajnalka,a perfect host and person of kindness and hospitality.She explained us everything in details and gave us useful tips for the accommodation.The apartment was perfect,right in the heart of the city and everything was really closed.Chain bridge was near the house and we had a great view. I definitely recommend and loved this house!!!! Thank you for everything ms Hajnalka \n\nHajnalka's apartment was perfect! A great location and a lovely little space. Hajnalka was very warm and helpful when we arrived, and all the basics were on offer to make our stay comfortable. \n\nHajnalka was very kind, very professional and efficient. The location of the apartment was right in the centre, and everything was within a walking distance which was great. Would highly recommend!\n\nThe apartment literally cannot be located better. Right in front of the chain bridge and amongst luxury hotels such as the four seasons and intercontinental, you cannot find a better location. Very large apartment with a window view of the bridge. Hajnalka was also amazingly accommodating. This is the ultimate location for a trip to Budapest!\n\nHajnalka was the perfect host. She helped us a lot with our lost baggage :(. We truly recommend this apartment if you have the chance to visit Budapest. The apartment is in a perfect location and easy to access. It has lift, which is not so common in Budapest.\n\nWe absolutely loved our stay at Hajnalkas' apartment. Even though there was 4 of us there was plenty of room! The flat is in the most central location for exploring the beautiful city, with lots to do just on your doorstep. \r\n\r\nWe were very impressed with the way Hajnalka welcomed us and accommodated us throughout our stay. We would 100% recommend this fantastic apartment! Thanks once again Hajnalka! \n\nHajnalka was a lovely, perfect host, and the flat is in an absolutely perfect spot for seeing Budapest. Hajnalka met us at the flat and went over everything with us. Everything was spotless and the pictures actually don't do the flat the justice.

You could not ask for a better location.   Two minutes and you are at the water looking across the river at the gorgeous Parliament building.   A large supermarket is likewise two minutes away.   Yet, the apartment is VERY quiet....very quiet.   In 10-15 minutes you can walk up a hill to the Castle area.  This is not to be missed and you are right there.   We would walk up there in the morning and enjoy the view before the river boat tour groups arrive.  It's really lovely.  Transportation is equally amazing...you are moments from the underground metro...very easy to travel anywhere yo want!   However, for (URL HIDDEN)  of the best parts of our stay ws meeting Viktor!

Communication with Viktor was brief and effective.\r\n\r\nJames\n\nAbsolutely brilliant in every respect! Location? You simply cannot do better in Budapest.  Its  in the heart of Budapest, the Buda Castle is 5 minutes by foot. All the cultural sights, museums, restaurants are easy to reach. \r\nFlat? Lovely, quiet, well-equipped and well-kept.

Dette kostet 9000 forint (28 euro), og anbefales. Viktor snakket engelsk og tysk, m\u00f8tte opp ved ankomst og ga oss gode r\u00e5d og tips for oppholdet.

Borgbyen er i kort g\u00e5avstand om du er i form til \u00e5 g\u00e5 i trapper. Vi ble anbefalt en b\u00e5ttur p\u00e5 Donau til Szentendre, noe som vi likte godt. Sm\u00e5byen hadde hyggelige sm\u00e5butikker i store mengder, dog mye beregnet p\u00e5 turister. Ta lokaltoget tilbake.

We exchanged mobile numbers and so could be in contact had there been a problem. Fortunately everything went smoothly.

We would not hesitate to recommend this accommodation.\n\nCharlie is a great host, communication was clear, and the apartment was very nice. I would definitely recommend to stay here!\n\nCharlie was extremely helpful, replying very quickly to questions and solving any problems. He also gave great advice on where to go and eat. The flat was nice and quiet and well-located. Everything was within walking and cycling distance. I used the MOL BuBi cycle hire and never once had to use public transport other than to return to the airport.\r\nThanks for a great stay Charlie!\r\n\n\nCharlie is a nice landlord. He makes it his job to make your way around the city. And through the Wathsapp always around for a question. It's a nice house to feel as Hungarian and it is in a nice part of town, close to public transport. Overall a good start for a nice trip.\n\nWe had a great time at Charlies appartement. The location is perfect for walking to main attractions as well as for going out at night - Lots of fancy bars and great restaurants are nearby.\r\nThe flat itself was super clean and spacious, the balcony a cute little extra. \r\nAlso regarding the communication there are no complaints from our side: Charly is a nice and uncomplicated person, who provided us with useful tipps where to go and what to see (we highly recommend to follow his advices where to eat also! :-)) \r\nI would come back anytime. \r\n\n\nCharlie was a great host. He was in communication with us from when we booked right up to when we arrived. He was so informative and gave us lots of recommendations which were all great. \nThe apartment was clean, spacious and in a perfect location. It was about a 15-20 min walk to the river but if you  fancied going further afield the metro and tram stop was only round the corner, where it was very easy to access the whole city. \nWe had a fabulous time and wouldn't hesitate to recommend Charlie or his apartment.\n\nCharlie is a fantastic host who had some great and detailed advice about what to see and eat in the city. \n\nThe apartment is in an amazing old building which is very secure and safe. It's walking distance to most things so it's a nice and convenient location. Nice little balcony with a view and inside it's quite spacious.\n\nI'd definitely recommend staying here!\n\nThe apartment in a hundred-years-old building is well located near to a 4/6 tram stop. The flat is close to cafes, restaurants, as well as to a typical Hungarian market with food store inside. It is quiet, clean and ideal for two, but possibly enough good for more people.

Both Tim and his girlfriend were very sweet, and gave us tons of suggestions to keep busy and eat well in the city. \n\nTim was a superb host! He thoughtfully contacted me before our arrival to check what time we'd reach Budapest, so that he could stay in to welcome us. And his place is very comfortable: well-lit and spacious and absolutely spotless. Tim was also very friendly and accommodating of our many questions, and did everything he could to make our stay wonderful, including battling water dragons with us at midnight. Also, his girlfriend makes a MEAN cocktail. 10/10 would recommend his place!\n\nAwesome host with a delightful room situated just a fun stroll from the \"city center\"...\n\nTim was a fantastic host!

We arrived early and he wasn't available to check in for a few hours; however he gave us great recommendations to begin our Budapest adventure, which was greatly appreciated!\r\nThe only semi-complaint we had was with the location. It was a bit of a hike to get to the main \"touristy\" areas of Buda and Pest (about 30 minutes), and about 15-20 minutes from the main area of the Jewish Quarter. However, this flat is close to a main bus line and not too far from a few metro stops, which was very nice. This is such a minor complaint, and at the price of the room, it was a great deal for all that we did get. Definitely recommend here for your stay!\n\nTims apartment was great, the room was a good size and it was easy to get to the city centre. Tim was a really easy going host, made us feel welcome and gave us some good tips for exploring the city. Would recommend!\n\nTim was a great host and helped point us toward some great sights in Budapest. His place was quiet and clean. Thank you for hosting us, Tim!\n\nTim is an excellent host. He cares about the comfort and needs of his guests and does his best to meet them. I'd recommend his place to anyone staying in Budapest. \n\nAlthough it was a spontanious booking, everything went perfectly well. It was a very clean and nicely styled room in the heart of Budapest, owned by a lovely couple who did everything to make us feel at home.

The location was extremely convenient for us. Hope to come back again :)\n\nThe location was fantastic. Clean sheets and very cozy apartment. Andr\u00e1s had quick answears so that was good. But he needs to fix the showeleak and the hole in the bathroom. We liked our stay in budapest very much xx\n\nI highly recommend staying in this studio. The location is excellent, just short walk to the Buda Castle. Andr\u00e1s was very responsive and always in touch. \n\nAndras organized the checkin well, we arrived during the day time. Andras was a friendly host: He brought us some toilet paper when we were about to run out. Also, he replied fast to our messages. One thing that irritated us was that Andras said there would be a surprise waiting for us in the flat - but we did not find any.\nThe flat itself has nice furniture and the bed is comfortable. \nHowever, things need to get fixed: the kitchen light was broken, we could not find a trash can, there was a hole in the wall (you could see cables), the balcony door did not close properly. Most importantly the bathroom is a total mess. \nThe shower was leaking and they \"fixed\" it by putting a towel in front of it. When the towel was so soaked that we put a new one there, there were small worms underneath it. Also, there was a small hole in the bathroom floor covered by a rug. The ceiling was moldy and it smelled disgusting.\nOverall the flat has potential but we would not rent it again considering the current state of it.\n\nThe apartment is very well located, in good condition and quiet. However, the toilet leaks water -which is hazardous- and the hosts were not particularly attentive. In two occasions we asked them for help and they failed to fulfill our requests effectively and on time. \n\nGreat location and good setup! Not a lot of natural light and kitchen light doesn't work so made it a bit dark at times, also kettle didn't work properly & shower (or something) was leaking making the bathroom floor quite wet. Other than that it's a good little studio with a comfy bed would recommend :)\n\nLovely apartment, waking up with th birds singing through the window. Perfect for visiting Budapest, close to everything. Spartan but practical and cosy, clean and handy, with everything you need, including Nespresso coffee machine. The hosts are kind and helpful and speak many languages, they are well travelled and therefore they understand your needs. Recommended. \n\nAndras and Greta were very kind hosts, although we couldn't meet they arranged everything for us perfectly and were easily reachable. The flat is very nice and conform to the description, perfectly located.

This is on the Buda side, where the castle and old historic sites are and the Gellert hotel. The location is awesome. From the one side of the building you are next to the famous chain bridge and can walk across in 15 minutes to the best parts of Pest, including V\u00e1ci street.  If you exit on the other side of the building you can walk up to the Matyas church and Var and fisherman's bastion in minutes. It's a wonderful place to stay. \n\nVery beautiful apartment , decorated with a lot of tastes and well situated, Ildik\u00f3 was very nice with us, very helpfully and we really thank her! \n\nIIdik\u00f3 was really helpful and friendly. The apartment was modern and clean in a really central location. \n\nVery nice apartment. Awesome location. We loved it. \n\nIldiko is a attentive landload, her house is beautiful and cozy. Especially the locations is right in the sightseeing spots! Can go anywhere by walk and trams. I had a great experience in Budapest, will be back again. \n\nStunning apartment set in a perfect location right next to the Chain Bridge and local transport (trams and buses). Everything you want to see & do (house of pariliament, royal palace, thermal baths etc) are at a stone throw away or easily accessible. \r\n\r\nWe received fantastic service from Ildiko who contacted me a few days before to give me information. On arrival she greeted us at the door to show us to the apartment, eventhough we arrived very late at night. \r\nIldiko is warm & welcoming despite her limited English & provided us with useful information (e.g map & bus routes etc) which was handy during our stay in Budapest. \r\n\r\nThe modern apartment is beautifully decorated, immaculate & had everything you need for a comfortable stay. Ildiko even kindly stocked the fridge & cupboard with some much appreciated basics such as coffee, tea, sugar, lemon squash, snacks & fruits etc. \r\nShe is always easily contactable and would reply straight away via email and text if you have any queries or concerns. As a host we cannot fault her! \r\n\r\nThe building itself is a large traditional period property, full of old charm & character with an ornate elevator from a time gone by that is still functional. On the evening, it is very dark (you have to press light switches on the walls for light)  & quiet & in our opinion this apartment possibly may not be suitable for the lone female traveller as it can be a little creepy at night going into the building & make your way back to your apartment. Having said that once you walk into your apartment, you feel completely relaxed, safe & comfortable. So take note if you are a scaredy cat & travelling in wintertime!\r\n\r\nOverall we as a group of three girls highly recommend this beautiful apartment & we wouldn't hesitate to book this apartment again.\n\nIldik\u00f3 treated us with a warm welcome, including champagne. The apartment is absolutely beautiful and the location is the best in my opinion. It is beneath the royal palace and across the chain bridge. Only a 10 min beautiful walk over the bridge brings you in the city centre where you want to be. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this apartment. \n\nIldiko was a great host! She gave us great directions to the place and touched base with us to make sure everything was going good! The apartment is in a great location and she was very helpful to give us directions to any of the major sites!\n\nWonderful appartment, clean and friendly, Ildiko was a perfect Host... Welcome Drink ... Bottle of red wine...\r\nShe answered our SMS immidietly and Sent us a Perfect Description how to get there ...\r\nI can recomend this appartment to anyone !!\n\nBeautiful, quiet apartment in gorgeous old building, minutes away from the castle and the chain bridge.

Location is good, on 4th floor.She could even arrange airport pick-up by private Cab for us to avoid navigating on arrival & had the Cab driver drop us off right outside the building gate until she came along. Kristina`s place is chic, functionally well equipped and clean. Help is very prompt and you can get all kind of information to make your visit a memorable one. The building in an old one which is what the neighbourhood is all about. The apartment is very modern and cheerful . Very close to the Jewish quarter and Bars etc, a short walk to the Metro Station / Trams / Bus Stop / Bank /SPAR Supermarket etc.Recommend the place for its location.\n\nGreat central location easy walking distance to main attractions and in the same area as ruin bars and great restaurants! Krisztina was so helpful and will definitely be recommending her home to anyone travelling to Budapest!

The hosts were wonderful and extremely accommodating. We were able to explore the city and the apartment's location was perfect for walking everywhere. Definitely recommend! \n\nHad a fantastic stay here and a fantastic time in Budapest.  This apartment couldn't be more ideally located - even if you were to drop a pin on a map.  Close to everything but also quiet and on a side street, even a few minutes walk to the Metro.  The apartment was as descibed and worked perfectly for my stay.  I'd highly recommend the Kiraly Loft Studio to anyone visiting Budapest. \n\nWe loved this apartment! It's the perfect location, close to all the restaurants and nightlife, the beautiful Jewish quarter and the city centre is within reach, it's right on the metro station and close to all the other public transportation. \r\nKinga waited for us patiently late at night and explained eveything, she was great and friendly and when we asked for extra blankets she got us and brought them to the place. The hosts also made sure we had everything we needed, including heating and stoves for cooking because the gas system was down during our stay. They were caring and attentive. \r\nThe apartment is very comfortable, the kitchen is great and well equipped and the washing machine has a fast program, which made our lives easier. \r\nThis is a perfect find, would definitely recommend it. \n\nWe loved our stay at this apartment, the arrival was smooth, the loft was cozy and clean, absolutely perfect for a weekend getaway. \n\nThe Appartement is very comfortable, you can find everything you need and its very clean.The owner are very nice. They had good advices what to Do in Budapest!  The Location from the Appartement is great. Close to the City Center and lots of very good bars arround:) very easy to get from there to the airport.\n\ntamas and kinga were great hosts ! they were able for any question . \nthe flat is in just a perfect location, 1 min walking to opera, and just on a main street with lots of pubs and restaurants. about 10 min walkimg to vaci utca. \n it was clean and had everything we needed.\nwe got bottle of wine and lots of travelling maps and magazines, which helped us alot in planning our trip . \nwe highly recomend the flat.\ncouldnt ask for more. just perfect !\n\nI had a great stay at Tamas & Kinga's place.  The loft has everything you need and located in a central position close to many shops, restaurants and public transportation as well as within walking distance to many attractions.\n\nI had a great stay at their flat.  Room was comfortable and clean.  Kinga met me at the door and provided info on nearby attractions.  The location was especially convenient and would recommend it to others.  \n\nOne item to note, the nearby church for some reason rings their bells literally hundreds of times at 8pm.  I'm not sure why, most bell towers ring the equivalent number of times to signify the hour but this one is absurd...\n\nThe day before departure Tamas booked a private car for me to the airport (black car) which turned out even better than a yellow taxi.  Sammy, the driver was prompt and friendly and cheaper than expected.\n\nThanks again!\n\nThe apartment represented perfectly the add's photos, it was really well clean and decorated.\r\nI enjoyed a lot my stay at Tamas & Kinga's place.\n\nOverall it was a very positive airbnb experience and i would recommend Tamas&Kinga apartment!\r\n\r\nWe were coming quite late but that wasn't an issue for our hosts and they've organised the check in very well and we've communicated all the details up front so we got to the apartment without any problems.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is a comfortable studio, furnished, clean and equipped with all the necessities for a stay. It's a studio flat on the ground floor with  with double bed on entresol + additional sofa bed. \r\nAlthough its in lively neighborhood it was very quite and nothing disturbed us.\r\nNice touch- fruits and water waiting for us upon arrival.\r\n\r\nWe chose this apartment for its location and it was spot on! In the very heart of the old Jewish district it is few steps from great bars, pubs, restaurants etc. We had all that we wanted within 5 min walk which was exactly what we hoped for. Tamas & Kinga left us a simple guide with some tips on best places to eat, drink as well other things to do in Budapest.\r\n\r\nChecking out was also quick and easy- we were leaving early, so we haven't met in person but communication was very good & we arranged everything.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a quite hideout in one of the best locations in Budapest i would recommend Tamas&Kinga apartment!", "accommodates": "3", "spa": "", "breakfast": false, "property_type": "Loft", "check_in_time": "Anytime after 3PM", "availability": "2 nights minimum stay", "host_reviews": "2344", "beds": "2", "doorman": false, "reference": "/users/show/10267598", "buzzer_of_wireless_intercom": false, "review_summary": "Our newly refurbished cute studio is very comfortable for up to 3 people and situated in the very heart of Budapest downtown.

I recomend this place.\n\n The location is good but the space is quite small. Considering the price per night, it is good place to stay for two nights.\n\nThe hostel was great. In typical hostel fashion, there were lots of friendly people, and a lot of interesting memories to go along with that. The accommodations were fine as expected, including cleanliness and a safe place to store belongings. But also, the hostel is in a location that is central to the Pest side of town and near the metro. And the chain bridge over to the Buda side is just a few blocks away in walking distance.

For us it was a perfect place just to be together. Thank you!\n\nHi all, I suggestiva you this flat because in clean with nice forniture and really comfortable. It's situated in a safe a nice area where you can find restaurants and bars in add there metro station really close. Aikos is really available to reply to all requests.\nI suggest you this accomodation, you will have a good permanence!\n\nLocation is great, as is WIFI. Good value for money-it is cheap! One should note it is on the 3rd floor with no elevator in case this is an issue.\n\n\u00c1kos apartment is in a great location in Buda cause the castle and also public transport is very close. His wife Patr\u00edcia showed me around and for the first look the flat was very nice. But after a bit my girlfriend and I saw that the bed sadly was in a bad condition (you could feel the frame of the left mattress). Also the hot water in the shower only worked while we used the tab in the bathroom at the same time (think the gas heating for the hot water should be adjusted). Besides those two issues the stay was really good and the communication with Patr\u00edcia was fine.\n\nThis apartment is in the heart of Budapest - you need to go only 5 minutes on foot from flat to the river bank (with unforgettable view to Parliament building. The flat is modern, clean and comfortable. The only minus was water in bathroom - firstly, it was hard to get warm water because it changed from very hot to very cold. But later everything was ok.\nThe view from the balcony is really adorable. I wish I could stay there few more times!\n\nAkos is a very nice guy and great host, however the photos don't reflect the apartment so well... They look quite polished. And, in addition to that, we didn't have toilet paper in the apartment, which was a  bit annoying because we had to get some first... Overall it was a good experience though! Great neighbourhood, nice host and sufficient space in the apartment :)\n\nThis a wonderful area. Very close to the metro and also within a short walk to the Castle area.  The Apartment is equipped with everything that you would need for a short stay. \n\nThe house is near of the center of city, we all enjoy these days in there\n\nAlthough we had a big delay and Akos had another appointment, he was really understanding. So,he made possible for us to enter. The appartment was nice and clean; also small and basic, but that doesn't mean anything bad. It was perfect for a couple. We had a good time in Budapest thank's to this appartment because it was super close to everything (some minutes to fisherman's bastion area and a few in metro to the other side of the river). The batthyany station is about 3 minutes or so, and you can see everyday the parliament when you go there. The bridge is near too, nice for a walk to the Pest area. \nIn the end, the location was one of the best points. I really recomend the stay. \n\nEverything was great! The apartment looks really like on the pictures. The communication with Akos in advance was perfect and he explained us all the doubts we have. The best thing of the apartment is the location, it's only about 15 minutes from the center.
